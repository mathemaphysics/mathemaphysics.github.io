  Abstract                 = {Eutectic mixtures of quaternary ammonium salts with Lewis or Br??nsted acids have been described as ionic liquid, but doubt exists over the compositional range for which this description is valid. In the current work, the conductivity, viscosity, density, and surface tension of a number of glycolic mixtures with choline chloride are measured over the mole fraction range 0 to 0.33. The data are fitted to hole theory, and it is proposed that the composition at which the measured conductivity matches the theoretical value is the point at which hole mobility becomes the dominant mechanism for charge mobility. For the mixtures of ethylene glycol and butanediol, this occurs at a ChCl mole fraction of approximately 0.2.},

This liquid exhibits on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) an electrochemical window of 4 V, which is limited in the anodic regime by the degradation of HOPG, in the cathodic regime by the irreversible reduction of the organic cation. A silicon layer with a thickness of 100 nm exhibits a band gap of 1.0&#xa0;Â±&#xa0;0.2 eV, which is shown by in situ current/voltage tunneling spectroscopy, indicating that semiconducting silicon was electrodeposited. },

For The Surface Tension And Its Temperature And Composition Dependences, Good Agreement With Experimental Determinations Is Achieved. A Comparison Of The Structure Of Licl And Kcl Interfaces Allows Us To Discuss The Relevance Of Size Asymmetry Effects On Interfacial Properties. These Effects Are Apparent In The Structure Of The Licl Interface, But Only When A Description Of Polarization Interactions Is Included In The Potential Model. Polarization Facilitates The Formation Of A Displacement Dipole Moment Across The Interface By Allowing An Opposing Electronic Dipole Moment Of Approximately The Same Magnitude, So That The Total Dipole Moment Is Always Small And Thus Not Unfavorable From An Electrostatic Point Of View. The Study Of The Binary Mixtures Shows That The Surface Tension Is Relatively Insensitive To The Specific Licl Concentration For A Broad Range Of Compositions. This Is Explained By Potassium Segregation Towards The Surface. In These Cases, Where Segregation Effects Are Important, We Have Found That Very Long Simulations (Several Nanoseconds Long) Are Needed In Order To Obtain Converged Density Profiles. For All The Systems Studied, The Local Ion Coordination Number Reduces To 50\% Of Its Bulk Value Only When The Ion Density Has Reduced To Less Than 5\% Of Its Bulk Value, Showing The Importance Of Clustering Effects In This Kind Of Interface.

Hence, There Do Not Appear To Be Additional Long-Range Effects Arising From The Coulombic Interactions. Techniques Used To Avoid Truncation Effects In The Coulombic And Dispersion Interactions Appear To Have Eliminated System Size Dependent Artefacts From These Sources. The Scaling Behavior Predicted From Cw Theory Is Used To Predict The Bulk Surface Tension For The Chosen Interaction Potential, Which Is Then Compared With Experimental Values, And Very Good Agreement Found.

Recent publications have attempted to determine the polarity of RTILs using empirical solvent polarity scales. The results have indicated that most RTILs have similar polarities. Nevertheless, RTILs are capable of behaving quite differently when used as solvents in organic synthesis, matrixes in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, liquid-liquid extraction, and as stationary phases in gas chromatography. The work presented in this study uses a linear free energy approach to characterize 17 RTILs on the basis of their distinct multiple solvation interactions with probe solute molecules. This model provides data that can be used to help identify the interactions and properties that are important for specific chemical applications.},

(IL). We find that water is closely assocd. with the anions and that its presence enhances both the translational and rotational dynamics of the IL. In agreement with expts., we find that the fluorescence spectra of Coumarin-153 is red-shifted because of the presence of water. Small amts. of water enhance the speed of relaxation of the solvent surrounding the solute probe after photoexcitation, but only at a "local environment" level. Interconversion between environments still occurs on a long time scale compared with the fluorescence lifetime of the probe. Excitation wavelength-dependent emission is obsd. both in the neat IL and in the IL+water mixt.},

%  Abstract                 = {In this article, we investigate the excited state intramolecular electron transfer (ET) reaction of crystal violet lactone (CVL) in the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Pr-31(+)][Tf2N-]. This system was chosen in light of recent experimental observations by Maroncelli and co-workers (J. Phys. Chem. B 2007, 111, 13473), in which the kinetics of electron transfer between S, (commonly referred as LE) and S-2 (Commonly referred as CT) emission states and, therefore, the ratio of emitting populations were shown to be absorption-wavelength-dependent. Our computational studies indicate that the kinetics of the intramolecular ET between S-1 and S-2 states of CVL in [Pr-31(+)][Tf2N-] is local solvent-environment-dependent. Because emission time scales are smaller than solvent relaxation time scales, this behavior is characteristic of RTILs but uncommon in conventional solvents. Therefore, RTILs open a window of opportunity for manipulating the outcome of chemical reactions simply by tunning the initial excitation wavelength. Our studies show that when acetonitrile is used as a solvent instead of [Pr-31(+)][Tf2N-] the ratio of populations of emission states is independent of excitation wavelength, eliminating the opportunity for influencing the outcome of reactions.},

The liquid???liquid equilibrium (LLE) at 25 ??C for the ternary systems ([Cnmim][NTf2] + hexane + benzene), with n taking the values 4, 8, 10, and 12, were determined. These data were analyzed and compared to those previously reported for the system ([C2mim][NTf2] + hexane + benzene). The results show that short alkyl chains on the imidazolium cation of the ionic liquid lead to a better extractive separation of benzene and hexane, and reveal the influence of the relative degree of ordering in the ionic liquids on the extraction parameters.},

%  Abstract                 = {Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) are low-melting-point organic salts that, until recently, were thought to have homogeneous microstructure. In this work, we investigate nanoscale segregation of short (<C4) alkyl chain ILs using propylammonium nitrate (PAN) and ethylammonium nitrate (EAN). Structure peaks at q = 0.54 A-1 for PAN and at q = 0.66 A-1 for EAN, corresponding to Bragg spacings (D* = 2pi/qmax) of 11.6 and 9.7 A respectively, provide the first experimental evidence of nanoscale heterogeneity for ILs with alkyl chains less than C4. The observation that these ILs are not optically birefringent and the fits obtained suggest a disordered, locally smectic or sponge-like structure. Solvophobic interaction between alkyl groups is the most important factor for the production of nanoscale heterogeneities, but electrostatic and hydrogen bonding attractions between the amine nitrogen and the nitrate anion will also play a role.},

%  Abstract                 = {A New Closure To The Ornstein-Zernike (Oz) Equation Is Proposed For Ionic Liquids And Is Investigated For Primitive Models Of High Valency (2:2) Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions And Molten Salts. The New Closure, Which Is Related To An Earlier Closure For The Soft-Sphere Case Proposed By Ichiye And Haymet, May Be Viewed As A Prescription For The So-Called `'Bridge Functions.'' These Functions Are Approximated By Zero In The Hypernetted-Chain (Hnc) Closure Which Is Generally Used For Ionic Systems. In Both The New Closure And The Soft-Sphere Closure, The Recognition That The Unlike Bridge Function Is Opposite In Sign From The Like Bridge Function Leads To An Approximation For These Missing Graphs By Adding (For The Unlike Case) Or Subtracting (For The Like Case) A Set Of Graphs Similar To Those Used In Percus-Yevick Theory To The Hnc Equation. Compared To The Hnc Closure, The Pair Correlation Functions Predicted For Primitive Models By The New Closure Are Generally In Much Better Agreement With Monte Carlo (Mc) Simulations Of Molten Salts And Aqueous 2:2 Electrolytes. The Fundamental Improvement Of This Paper Over The Ichiye-Haymet Work Is That The Separation Of Long- And Short-Range Part Of C(R) For The Hard-Sphere Case Is Clearly Defined, Whereas It Was Done Numerically For The Soft-Sphere Case. Moreover, The Present Theory Is In Better Agreement With Mc Simulations Both In The Molten Salt As Well As In The Dilute Solution Regimes Than The Soft-Sphere Case. Finally, A Study Was Made Of The Transition Of The Like Charge Pair Correlation Functions From Monotonic Behavior At Low Densities To A Nonmonotonic Behavior At High Densities. The New Closure Clearly Predicts Such A Transition Region At Concentrations Near 0.02 M And Temperatures Near 314 K. There Is Also A Region Below 0.02 M And 314 K Where The New Closure Fails To Converge. Compared To Mc Simulations, The Critical Region Predicted By The New Closure Appears To Be A Lower Estimate. However, For The Hnc Closure There Is Only A Remote Possibility Of Such A Transition Region Since The Correlation Functions Are Nonmonotonic Even At Lower Concentrations, A Feature Which Is Corrected In The New Theory.},

Neutral and charged species have been considered up to a size (30 [bmim][Tf] pairs) well into the nanometric range. Free energy computations and thermodynamic modeling have been used to predict the equilibrium composition of the vapor phase as a function of temperature and density. The results point to a nonnegligible concentration of very small charged species at pressures (P ??? 0.01 Pa) and temperatures (T ??? 600 K) at the boundary of the stability range of [bmim][Tf]. Thermal properties of nanometric neutral droplets have been investigated in the 0 ??? T ??? 700 K range. A near-continuous transition between a liquidlike phase at high T and a solidlike phase at low T takes place at T ??? 190 K in close correspondence with the bulk glass point Tg ??? 200 K. Solidification is accompanied by a transition in the dielectric properties of the droplet, giving rise to a small permanent dipole embedded into the solid cluster. The simulation results highlight the molecular precursors of several macroscopic properties and phenomena and point to the close competition of Coulomb and dispersion forces as their common origin.},

%  Abstract                 = {Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are nonvolatile, tunable solvents that have generated significant interest across a wide variety of engineering applications. The use of RTILs as media for CO2 separations appears especially promising, with imidazolium-based salts at the center of this research effort. The solubilities of gases, particularly CO2, N2, and CH4, have been studied in a number of RTILs. Process temperature and the chemical structures of the cation and anion have significant impacts on gas solubility and gas pair selectivity. Models based on regular solution theory and group contributions are useful to predict and explain CO2 solubility and selectivity in imidazolium-based RTILs. In addition to their role as a physical solvent, RTILs might also be used in supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) as a highly permeable and selective transport medium. Performance data for SILMs indicates that they exhibit large permeabilities as well as CO2/N2 selectivities that outperform many polymer membranes. Furthermore, the greatest potential of RTILs for CO2 separations might lie in their ability to chemically capture CO2 when used in combination with amines. Amines can be tethered to the cation or the anion, or dissolved in RTILs, providing a wide range of chemical solvents for CO2 capture. However, despite all of their promising features, RTILs do have drawbacks to use in CO2 separations, which have been overlooked as appropriate comparisons of RTILs to common organic solvents and polymers have not been reported. A thorough summary of the capabilities???and limitations???of imidazolium-based RTILs in CO2-based separations with respect to a variety of materials is thus provided.},

%  Abstract                 = {We give a perspective on the relations between inorganic and organic cation ionic liquids (ILs), including members with melting points that overlap around the borderline 100 ??C. We then present data on the synthesis and properties (melting, boiling, glass temperatures, etc.) of a large number of an intermediate group of liquids that cover the ground between equimolar molecular mixtures and ILs, depending on the energetics of transfer of a proton from one member of the pair to the other. These proton-transfer ILs have interesting properties, including the ability to serve as electrolytes in solvent-free fuel cell systems. We provide a basis for assessing their relation to aprotic ILs by means of a Gurney-type proton-transfer free energy level diagram, with approximate values of the energy levels based on free energy of formation and pKa data. The energy level scheme allows us to verify the relation between solvent-free acidic and basic electrolytes, and the familiar aqueous variety, and to identify neutral protic electrolytes that are unavailable in the case of aqueous systems.},

Interestingly, The Diffusion Of The Heavier Cation Is Found To Be Faster Than The Anion, In Agreement With Experiment. The Interaction Model Is Found To Predict A Higher Viscosity And Lower Electrical Conductivity Compared To Experimental Estimates. Analysis Of The Latter Calculations Points To Correlated Ion Motions In This Melt. The Solvation Time Correlation Function For Dipolar And Ionic Probes Studied Using Equilibrium Simulations Exhibits Three Time Components, Which Include An Ultrafast (Subpicosecond) Part As Well As One With A Time Constant Of Around 150 Ps. The Ultrafast Solvent Relaxation Is Ascribed To The Rattling Of Anions In Their Cage, While The Slow Component Could Be Related To The Reorientation Of The Cations As Well As To Ion Diffusion.},

The Diffraction Patterns Were Similar, Although Not Identical, For The Same Halide Pairs And Showed Features Indicative Of Short-Range And Intermediate-Range Order. Quantum Chemical Calculations Were Carried Out On Alx4-, Al2x7- , And Al3x10- To Provide Information Needed To Interpret The Structural Results Within The Framework Of The Random Packing Of Structural Units Model. It Is Shown That The Bent Al-X-Al Bridge For Al2x7-, Obtained From The Quantum Chemical Calculations, Is Necessary To Represent Well The Structure, And That The Values Of The Bond Angles At The Central Halide Atoms Are Around 110-Degrees. Aluminum Atoms Are Found To Be Tetrahedrally Coordinated By The Halide Atoms, And Information On The Orientational Correlations Of Neighboring Al2x7- Is Derived.},

%  Abstract                 = { A many-body polarizable force field has been developed and validated for ionic liquids (ILs) containing 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium, 1-alkyl-2-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium, N-methyl-N-alkylpyrrolidinium, N-alkylpyridinium, N-alkyl-N-alkylpiperidinium, N-alkyl-N-alkylmorpholinium, tetraalkylammonium, tetraalkylphosphonium, N-methyl-N-oligoetherpyrrolidinium cations and BF4à¥???, CF3BF3à¥???, CH3BF3à¥???, CF3SO3à¥???, PF6à¥???, dicyanamide, tricyanomethanide, tetracyanoborate, bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (Ntf2à¥??? or TFSIà¥???), bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSIà¥???) and nitrate anions. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed on 30 ionic liquids at 298, 333, and 393 K. The IL density, heat of vaporization, ion self-diffusion coefficient, conductivity, and viscosity were found in a good agreement with available experimental data. Ability of the developed force field to predict ionic crystal cell parameters has been tested on four ionic crystals containing Ntf2à¥??? anions. The influence of polarization on the structure and ion transport has been investigated for [emim][BF4] IL. A connection between the structural changes in IL resulting from turning off polarization and slowing down of ion dynamics has been found. Developed force field has also provided accurate description/prediction of thermodynamic and transport properties of alkanes, fluoroalkanes, oligoethers (1,2-dimethoxyethane), ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, hydrazine, methyhydrazine, dimethylhydrazine, acetonitrile, dimethyl amine, and dimethyl ketone. },

%  Abstract                 = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (mppy+TFSI-) from 303 to 393 K to improve understanding of the structure and ion transport of this ionic liquid. The density, ion self-diffusion coefficients, conductivity, and viscosity of mppy+TFSI- predicted from MD simulations are in good agreement with experimental measurements. The time-dependent shear modulus of the ionic liquids was calculated and compared with that for nonionic liquids. On average each mppy+ cation was found to be coordinated by four TFSI- anions. The angular distributions of NTFSINmppy+NTFSI and Nmppy+NTFSI-Nmppy+ exhibit a maximum at 8090o and a second maximum at 180o. Correlation of ion motion was found to lower ionic conductivity by approximately one-third from the expected value based upon ion self-diffusion coefficients. Rotational motion of the cation and anion are anisotropic with the degree of anisotropy increasing with decreasing temperature. Electrostatic interactions are responsible for slowing down the dynamics of the ionic liquid by more than an order of magnitude and a dramatic decrease of the time-dependent shear modulus.},

The salts have amphiphilic characteristics, and the thermotropic phase behavior of these salts and the analogous tetrafluoroborate salt has been investigated by variable temperature small-angle X-ray scattering, polarizing optical microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The salts form lamellar, sheetlike arrays in the crystalline phase and an enantiomeric smectic liquid crystalline phase at higher temperatures, except for the salts containing the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion which melt directly to form isotropic liquids. The nature of the anion influences the size of the interlayer spacing in both the crystal and in the mesophase. The interlayer spacing in the mesophase is largest for the anions with the greatest ability to form a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding lattice, following the order [TFI](-) < [OTf](-) < [BF4](-) < Br- < Cl-.},

Analysis Of The Cavity Size Distribution Functions Provides A Quantitative View Of The Hole Sizes Arising In Ionic Liquids When Approaching The Coexistence Region. Cavities Of Sizes 0.1-1 Nm Are Formed, The Larger Cavities Being Favored By The Coulombic Forces. The Mean Cavity Size Grows With The Square Root Of The Temperature. We Compute The Reversible Work Needed To Create A Cavity In The Ionic Liquid And It Is Used To Estimate The Surface Tension Of The Ionic Liquid-Vapor Interface. The Accuracy Of Theoretical Approaches Based On The Scaled Particle Theory And Ornstein-Zernike Equation To Estimate The Cavity Work Of Formation In Ionic Liquids Is Discussed. We Find That Both Simulations And Integral Equations Predict Density Depletion With Increasing Cavity Size, Suggesting The Existence Of Surface Drying In Ionic Liquids.

The Nature Of The Charge Affects Several Aspects Of Solvation, From Electrostriction To The Mutual Disposition Of Cations Around The Solute; Nevertheless, The Long-Range Screening Behavior Of The Liquid Appears To Be Insensitive To Both Charge And Dimensions Of The Solute. The Ion Solvation Is Energy Driven, As Expected For The Nature Of The Solvent, And Displays A Marked Asymmetry Between Cation And Anion Solvation Chemical Potential. Such Asymmetry Is Dependent, Even Qualitatively, On The Ionic Liquid Chosen As Solvent. Partial Molar Volumes Of Ions In Solution Are Found To Follow The Nature Of Ion-Solvent Interaction.

%  Abstract                 = {Nanometer-scale structuring in room-temperature ionic liquids is observed using molecular simulation. The ionic liquids studied belong to the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium family with hexafluorophosphate or with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide as the anions, [Cnmim][PF6] or [Cnmim][(CF3SO2)2N], respectively. They were represented, for the first time in a simulation study focusing on long-range structures, by an all-atom force field of the AMBER/OPLS_AA family containing parameters developed specifically for these compounds. For ionic liquids with alkyl side chains longer than or equal to C4, aggregation of the alkyl chains in nonpolar domains is observed. These domains permeate a tridimensional network of ionic channels formed by anions and by the imidazolium rings of the cations. The nanostructures can be visualized in a conspicuous way simply by color coding the two types of domains (in this work, we chose red = polar and green = nonpolar). As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the nonpolar domains become larger and more connected and cause swelling of the ionic network, in a manner analogous to systems exhibiting microphase separation. The consequences of these nanostructural features on the properties of the ionic liquids are analyzed.},

%  Abstract                 = { The conformational landscapes of two commonly used ionic liquid ions, the anion bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (Ntf2) and the cations N-propyl- and N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium, were investigated using data obtained from Raman spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, and ab initio techniques. In the case of Ntf2, the plotting of three-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PES) and the corresponding molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed the existence of two stable isomers (each existing as a pair of enantiomers) and evidenced the nature of the anion as a flexible, albeit hindered, molecule capable of interconversion between conformers in the liquid state, a result confirmed by the Raman data. In the case of the N,N-dialkylpyrrolidinium cations, the PES show a much more limited conformational behavior of the pyrrolidinium ring (pseudorotation). Nevertheless, such pseudorotation produces two stable isomers with the propyl and butyl side chains in completely different positions (axial-envelope and equatorial-envelope conformations). This result was also confirmed by Raman spectra analyses and MD simulations in the liquid phase. The implications of the conformational behavior of the two types of ions are discussed in terms of the solvation properties of the corresponding ionic liquids. },

A great deal of progress has been made in just the past five years toward identifying the factors that cause these salts to have low melting points and other useful properties. Supramolecular structure and organization have emerged as important and complicated topics that may be key to understanding how chemical reactions and other processes are affected by ionic liquids. New questions are posed and an active debate is ongoing regarding the nature of nanoscale ordering in ionic liquids. The topic of reactivity in ionic liquids is still relatively unexplored; however, the results that have been obtained indicate that distributed kinetics and dynamical heterogeneity may sometimes, but not always, be influencing factors.},

%  Abstract                 = {Tables for form factors and anomalous dispersion are of wide general use in the UV, x-ray and gamma-ray communities, and have existed for a considerable period of time. Much of the recent theoretical basis for these was contributed by Cromer, Mann and Liberman while much of the experimental data was synthesised by Henke et al. More recent developments in both areas have led to new and revised tables. The generality of these works has entailed numerous simplifications compared to detailed relativistic S-matrix calculations; however, the latter do not appear to give convenient tabular application for the range of Z and energy of general interest. Conversely, the former tables appear to have large regions of limited validity throughout the range of Z and energies, and in particular have limitations with regard to extrapolation to energies outside tabulated ranges. Herein, the primary interactions of x-rays with isolated atoms from Z = 1 (hydrogen) to Z = 92 (uranium) are described and computed within a self-consistent Dirac-Hartree-Fock framework. This has general application across the range of energy from 1-10 eV to 400-1000 keV, with limitations (described below) as the low- and high-energy extremes are approached. Tabulations are provided for the f1 and f2 components of the form factors, together with the photoelectric attenuation coefficient for the atom, ?, and the value for the K-shell, ?K, as functions of energy and wavelength.

%  Abstract                 = {Octanol-water partition coefficients are extraordinarily successful for correlating and predicting numerous processes of pharmacological and environmental importance. The amphiphilic nature of the 1-octanol molecules allows the octanol phase to mimic the complexities of many different environments ranging from biomembranes to soil. However, the structural details of the octanol phase and whether its structure is altered upon water saturation are not yet fully understood. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble demonstrate, that a diverse spectrum of hydrogen-bonded aggregates exists in dry and wet 1-octanol, and that water saturation substantially alters the 1-octanol environment from predominantly linear aggregates in dry octanol to larger cylindrical micelles with water cores in wet octanol. These simulation results are able to reconcile the conflicting views (chainlike or water-centered aggregates vs spherical micelles) of the 1-octanol structure inferred from thermodynamic arguments, spectroscopic measurements, and diffraction experiments. Calculated partition constants quantify the influence of water saturation on the solubility characteristics of the dry and wet octanol phases.},

Cation Diffusion Coefficient Is Higher Than Those Of Anion And Oxygen Atoms Of Peo Chains. Ionic Mobility In Peo/{[}Bmim]Pf6 Is Higher Than In Peo/{[}Dmim]Pf6, So That The Ionic Conductivity Kappa Of The Former Is Approximately Ten Times Larger Than The Latter. The Ratio Between Kappa And Its Estimate From The Nernst-Einstein Equation Kappa/Kappa(Ne), Which Is Inversely Proportional To The Strength Of Ion Pairs, Is Higher In Ionic Liquid Polymer Electrolytes Than In Polymer Electrolytes Based On Inorganic Salts With Li+ Cations. Calculated Time Correlation Functions Corroborate Previous Evidence From The Analysis Of Equilibrium Structure That The Ion Pairs In Ionic Liquid Polymer Electrolytes Are Relatively Weak. Structural Relaxation At Distinct Spatial Scales Is Revealed By The Calculation Of The Intermediate Scattering Function At Different Wavevectors. These Data Are Reproduced With Stretched Exponential Functions, So That Temperature And Wavevector Dependences Of Best Fit Parameters Can Be Compared With Corresponding Results For Polymer Electrolytes Containing Simpler Ions.

The Ils Primarily Investigated Are Based On The 1-Butyl-2,3-Dimethylimidazolium ({[}Bm2im]) Cation With Thiocyanate (Ncs-), Dicyanamide (N(Cn)(2)(-)), And Tetrafluoroborate (Bf4-) Anions. Spectroscopic Studies Are Carried Out Near 2000 Cm(-1) For The C\&3bond; N Stretching Bands Of Ncs- And N(Cn)(2)(-) As The Il Anion As Well As For Ncs-, N(Cn)(2)(-), And Azide (N-3(-)) Anions Dissolved In {[}Bm2im]{[}Bf4]. The Ver Studies Of N(Cn)(2)(-) Are Reported For The First Time. Ver Of N-3(-), Ncs-, And N(Cn)(2)(-) Is Measured In Normal Solvents, Such As N-Methylformamide, To Compare With The Il Solutions. The Spectral Shifts And Ver Rates Of The Anions In Il Solution Are Quite Similar To Those In Polar Aprotic, Conventional Organic Solvents, I.E., Dimethylsulfoxide, And Significantly Different Than Those In Methanol, In Which There Is Hydrogen Bonding. Similar Studies Were Also Carried Out For The Anions In Another Il, 1-Butyl-3-Methylimidazolium Tetrafluoroborate ({[}Bmim]{[}Bf4]), In Which The C2 Hydrogen Is Present. The Results For The Anions Are Similar To Those In The {[}Bm2im] Containing Ils, In Which The C2 Hydrogen Is Methyl Substituted. This Suggests That Substituting This Hydrogen Has, At Most, A Minor Effect On The Degree Of Hydrogen Bonding In The Anion-Il Solvation Interaction Based On The Infrared Spectra And Dynamics.

While The Original Wilson Theory Used To Explain The Wien Effect In Conventional Electrolytes Does Not Work Well For Ionic Liquids, A Minor Modification Of The Theory Allowed It To Be Used To Qualitatively Describe The Data. The Two Coarse-Graining Methods Were Noisier As Expected, But Result In A Significant Savings In Computational Cost.},

Comparison With Low-Temperature X-Ray Diffraction Data Shows That The Equilibrium Volume Predicted By Either Approximations Is Affected By Large Errors, Nearly Equal In Magnitude (Similar To 10\%), And Of Opposite Sign. In Both Cases The Error Can Be Traced To A Poor Description Of The Intermolecular Interactions, While The Intramolecular Structure Is Fairly Well Reproduced By Lda And Pbe-Gga. The Pbe-Gga Optimization Of Atomic Positions Within The Experimental Unit Cell Provides Results In Good Agreement With The X-Ray Structure. The Correct System Volume Can Also Be Restored By Supplementing Pbe-Gga With Empirical Dispersion Terms Reproducing The R(-6) Attractive Tail Of The Van Der Waals Interactions.

%  Abstract                 = {The structure and dynamics of the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate is studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We find long-range spatial correlations between the ions and a three-dimensional local structure that reflects the asymmetry of the cations. The main contribution to the configurational energy comes from the electrostatic interactions which leads to charge-ordering effects. Radial screening and three-dimensional distribution of charge are also analyzed. The motion of a single ion is studied via velocity and reorientational correlation functions. It is found that ions "rattle" in a long-lived cage, while the orientational structure relaxes on a time scale longer than 200 ps. As in a supercooled liquid, the mean square displacements reveal a subdiffusive dynamics. In addition, the presence of dynamic heterogeneities can be detected by analyzing the non-Gaussian behavior of the van Hove correlation function and the spatial arrangement of the most mobile ions. The short-time collective dynamics is also studied through the electric current time correlation function.},

Questions Have Been Recently Raised On The Use Of Kinetic Temperature Thermostats, Based On The Equipartition Principle, In Simulations Of Nonequilibrium Fluids And Using A Configurational Temperature Thermostat Has Been Suggested To Be More Realistic. To Further Ascertain The Results Obtained In This Work, We Study Molten Nacl With Both Kinetic And Configurational Temperature Thermostats. Since Configurational Thermostats Have Been So Far Restricted To Simple Fluids Or Alkanes, We First Apply Configurational Expressions For The Temperature To Molten Nacl, Test The Values So Obtained In Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulation For Various System Sizes And State Points And Finally Use Them To Thermostat Molten Nacl Under Shear. Nemd Results Obtained For Both Thermostats Show That Except For The So-Called Normal Stress Coefficients, Molten Salt Under Shear Exhibits Mostly The Same Features As A Simple Fluid Under Shear, I.E., Features In Agreement With The Mode-Coupling Theory. The Choice Of The Thermostatting Method Is Found To Have Little Influence On The Results For The Range Of Shear Rates Investigated. (C) 2003 American Institute Of Physics.},

By Contrast To The Debye-Huckel Theory, In The Strongly Coupled Regime, Lambda(Q) Increases With Increasing Coupling Strength (Also Seen In Bulk Ionic Simulations). The Nacl Fluid Confined Between Neutral (100) Nacl Surfaces Also Shows Weak Oscillatory Charge Decay Near The Surface. Similar Oscillatory Exponential Decay Was Seen When The Nacl Fluid Was Confined Between Two Analytically Smooth Neutral Walls. The Origin Of These Oscillations Was Due To The Difference In Ion Sizes. Nacl Fluid Confined Between Neutral Octopolar (110) And Dipolar (110) Surface Show Stronger Density Oscillations Than (100) Surface But Comparatively Very Weak Charge Oscillations. This Paper Shows That The Strength Of The Charges On The Crystal Surfaces Is Enough To Induce A Characteristic Spatial Distribution Of Charges In The Contacting Fluid And The Extent Of Distribution Depends On The Type Of Surface.

A lithium salt (LiBF4 or LiPF6) was added to these mixtures for possible application in the field of energy storage (batteries or supercapacitors). Viscosities, conductivities and electrochemical windows at a Pt electrode of these electrolytes were investigated. All studied electrolytes are stable toward oxidation and exhibit a vitreous phase transition, which has been determined by application of the \{VTF\} theory to conductivity measurements. Mixtures containing the BF4â?? anion exhibit the lowest viscosity and the highest conductivity. Two mixtures have been optimized in terms of conductivity: BL/IMIBF4 (60/40, v/v) and ACN/IMIBF4 (70/30, v/v). },

%  Abstract                 = {Abstract The aggregation behavior of two trisiloxane-tailed surface active ionic liquids (ILs), 1-methyl-3- trisiloxaneimidazolium chloride ([Si(3)Mim]Cl) and trisiloxanepyridinium chloride ([Si(3)Py]Cl), in aqueous solution was investigated by the measurement of surface tension, electrical conductivity, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface tension measurement showed the critical aggregation concentration (cac) of [Si(3)Mim]Cl and [Si(3)Py]Cl is 15.5 and 24.8&#xa0;mmol&#xa0;lâ??1 respectively, and the corresponding surface tension at cac (Î³cac) is 23.8 and 23.0&#xa0;mN&#xa0;mâ??1, respectively. The phenomenon was mainly ascribed to the branched trisiloxane hydrophobic moieties and these results demonstrated that the surface activity of these trisiloxane-tailed \{ILs\} was somewhat superior to that of conventional ILs. The vesicular-like structure of the aggregates was observed by \{TEM\} while \{DLS\} provided the diameter distribution of these aggregates. In addition, a probable two-layered arrangement of molecules in aggregates for the two \{ILs\} in aqueous solution was proposed based upon the results of \{XRD\} studies. This investigation may contribute to expand understanding of trisiloxane-tailed ILs. Furthermore, high thermal stability of such compounds may improve their potential applications in the fields of colloids and interfaces science. },

Furthermore, ionic liquids can catalyze these reactions with the only byproduct being water.},

%  Abstract                 = {Most ionic liquids (ILs) are characterized by the presence of some kind of isomer for component ions. We investigated the liquid and crystalline structures of 1-isopropyl-3-methylimidazolium halides ([i-C(3)mim]X, X = Br, I) by means of Raman scattering measurements backed up by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT calculations indicated that there are two stable rotational isomers Of [i-C(3)mim](+), one of an asymmetric form (Asym) and the other a symmetric one (Sym). For both salts, it was revealed that Asym and Sym coexist in liquid states, in contrast to the presence of only Asym in crystalline states. We determined the isomer populations and showed that Asym is dominant in the liquid states of both salts (approximately 7/3). Conformational changes in [i-C(3)mim](+) during the crystallizing and melting processes were observed by conducting simultaneous measurements using the techniques of Raman spectroscopy and calorimetry. We have revealed that the conformational change from Asym to Sym occurs gradually, with linking to melting in the premelting region. This is a conclusive observation of the structural changes of ILs in the premelting region and demonstrates the conformational changes between isomers during the crystallizing and melting processes.},

Data were collected using single and double potential step chronamperometry at a gold disk electrode of micrometer dimension, and analysed via fitting to the appropriate analytical expression or, where necessary, to simulation. The variation of diffusion coefficient with temperature was found to occur in an Arrhenius-type manner for all combinations of solute and solvent. For a given ionic liquid, the diffusional activation energies of each species were not only closely equivalent to each other, but also to the RTIL's activation energy of viscous flow. In acetonitrile supported with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate, the ratio in diffusion coefficients of the radial cation and dication tot he neutral molecule were calculated as 0.89 +/- 0.05 and 0.51 +/- 0.03, respectively. In contrast, amongst the ionic liquids the same ratios were determined to be on average 0.53 +/- 0.04 and 0.33 +/- 0.03. The consequences of this dissimilarity are considered in terms of the modelling of voltammetric data gathered within ionic liquid solvents.},

The goal is to elucidate the effect of alkyl side chain length and anion on the structure and dynamics of the mixtures. Replacing the BMIM+ cation with OMIM+ results in stronger aggregation of the cations and slower diffusion of the anions. Replacing the BF4- anion with Cl- alters the water distribution at low water mole fractions and slows diffusion in the mixtures. Potential experimental manifestations of the behavior in both cases are given.},

%  Abstract                 = {We recorded X-ray diffraction patterns from n-octane, n-octanol, and fully hydrated n-octanol. These patterns were analyzed using a modified version of the Percus-Yevick hard-sphere theory for liquids. A model is presented for the molecular organization of n-octanol that accurately predicts the observed diffraction patterns. The octanol molecules are associated in aggregates, with their hydroxyl groups forming roughly spherical clusters and their hydrocarbon chains pointing outwards, almost fully extended. When n-octanol is hydrated, the overall organization does not change greatly, but water molecules coordinate the hydroxyl groups in the clusters. Estimates are made for the maximum number of octanol molecules in the aggregates.},

The excitation transfer rate, which is sensitive to the distribution of chromophores in the RTIL, is modeled using different spatial configurations of 9PA molecules in the RTIL solution. The models are an isotropic distribution (random distribution) and a clustered sphere model to represent hydrophobic regions of a nanostructured environment. Model calculations were performed to demonstrate the sensitivity of excitation transfer to different distributions of chromophores. When compared to the experiment, the isotropic model can adequately match the data. From a Bayesian analysis of the sensitivity of the excitation transfer to the models for the spatial distribution of chromophores, an upper limit of 6 angstrom radius is placed on the size of hydrophobic domains in the RTIL.},

Radial distribution functions for both ionic liquids showed that the intermolecular correlations of ca. 5.5 and 10 angstrom a e significantly different from each other, unlike that of ca. 15 angstrom. MD simulations were also performed. It turns out that the methyl substitution at the C2 position of imidazolium causes variation of the orientation of the nearest neighboring ion-ion interactions without significant changes in the long-range ordering, probably longer than 15 angstrom, of the ionic liquids.},

The radial distribution function (RDF) indicates that the ionic liquid involves an ordered structure with significant intermolecular interactions at around 6, 10 and 16 A. In order to obtain information of intermolecular interactions in the range r<6 angstrom. where intra- and intermolecular interactions are overlapped, the RDF in terms of g(inter)(r) for the intermolecular interaction was extracted by subtracting the intramolecular g(intra)(r) from the observed g(r). Here, the gin,,,(r) was evaluated by taking into account the distribution of conformers, i.e., the el, e4 and e6 conformers for P-13(+) and the C-1 and C-2 conformers for FSI-. and by knowing their crystal structures. The distribution of the P-13(*) conformers has been established in a previous work. The distribution of the FSI- conformers was determined by Raman spectra of the ionic liquid in the range 270-400 cm(-1) at various temperatures. The ginter(F) thus extracted shows a peak at 3.6 angstrom, which may be ascribed to the specific contact ion-pair interaction Of P-13*FSI-. The Gibbs energy, enthalpy and entropy of conformational change from C2 to C, were evaluated to be -3(2) kJ mol(-1), 6.8(6) kJ mol(-1) and 33(3) J K-1 mol(-1), respectively.},

%  Abstract                 = {In This Study, We Have Compared The Interionic/Intermolecular Vibrational Dynamics Of Ionic Liquids (Ils) And Concentrated Electrolyte Solutions Measured By Femtosecond Optically Heterodyne-Detected Raman-Induced Kerr Effect Spectroscopy. A Typical Anion In Ils, Bis(Trifluoromethanesulfonyl)Amide ({[}Ntf2](-)), Has Been Chosen As The Anion For The Sample Ils And Concentrated Electrolyte Solutions. Ils Used In This Study Are 1-Butyl-3-Methylimidazolium, 1-Butylpyridinium, N-Butyl-N,N,N-Triethylammonium, And 1-Butyl-1-Methylpyrrolidinium With {[}Ntf2](-). Li{[}Ntf2] Solutions (Similar To 3.3 M) Of Water, Methanol, Propylene Carbonate, And Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Have Been Selected As Control Samples. Kerr Transients Of The Ils And Electrolyte Solutions Show Intra- And Interionic/Intermolecular Vibrational Dynamics Followed By Slow Picosecond Overdamped Relaxation. Fourier Transform Kerr Spectra Have Shown A Difference In The Relative Intensities Of Intraionic Vibrational Bands Of {[}Ntf2](-) (280-350 Cm(-1)) Between The Ils And Electrolyte Solutions. The Origin Of The Difference Is Attributed To The Change In The Conformational Equilibrium Between Cisoid And Transoid Forms Of {[}Ntf2](-), Which Is Caused By A Favorable Stabilization Of Dipolar Cisoid Form Due To Li+ And Dipolar Solvent Molecules In The Electrolyte Solutions. Low-Frequency Kerr Spectra (0-200 Cm(-1)) Exhibit Unique Features With The Variation Of Cation And Solvent Species. The Aromatic Ils Have A Prominent High-Frequency Librational Motion At About 100 Cm(-1) In Contrast To The Case For The Nonaromatic Ones. The Common Structure Of The Spectra Observed At About 20 Cm(-1) Likely Comes From An Interionic Motion Of {[}Ntf2](-). The Nonaromatic Ils Allow A Fair Comparison With The Electrolyte Solutions Of Propylene Carbonate And Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Because Of The Structural Similarities. The Comparison Based On The First Moment Of The Interionic/Intermolecular Vibrational Spectrum Suggests The Stronger Interionic/Intermolecular Interaction In The Concentrated Electrolyte Solutions Than The Ils.},

%  Abstract                 = {The solvation dynamics and local orientational friction for a series of four ionic liquids have been probed using coumarin 153 (C153) as a function of temperature. These ionic liquids are comprised of nonaromatic organic cations paired with a common anion, bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (NT ). The specific liquids are as follows:??? N-methyl-tri-N-butylammonium NTf2- (N1444+/NTf2-), N-hexyl-tri-N-butylammonium NTf2- (N6444+/NTf2-), N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium NTf2- (Pyrr14+/NTf2-), and N-methyl-N-ethoxyethylpyrrolidinium NTf2- (Pyrr1(2O2)+/NTf2-). The observed solvation dynamics and fluorescence depolarization dynamics occur over a broad range of time scales that can only be adequately fit by functions including three or more exponential components. Stretched exponential distributions cannot adequately fit our data. The solvation and reorientational dynamics of the C153 probe are studied over a range of temperatures from 278.2 to 353.2 K. For both the solvation dynamics and the probe reorientational dynamics, the observed temperature dependence is well fit by a Vogel???Tammann???Fulcher law. To correlate the observed microscopic dynamics with macroscopic physical properties, temperature-dependent viscosities are also measured. Differential scanning calorimetry is used to study the thermodynamics of the phase transitions from the liquid to supercooled liquid to glassy states. For the two tetraalkylammonium liquids, the observed melting transitions occur near 300 K, so we are able to study the dynamics in a clearly supercooled regime. Very long time scale orientational relaxation time constants dynamics on the order of 100 ns are observed in the C153 fluorescence anisotropy. These are interpreted to arise from long-lived local structures in the environment surrounding the C153 probe.},

Site-Site Pair Correlation Functions Reveal That The Anion Has A Strong Interaction With Any Three C-H's Of The Imidazolium Ring. The Ring Bends Over And Wraps Around The Anion Such That The Two Nitrogen Atoms Take A Distance To The Anion. Electron Donating Butyl Group Contributes The Electronic Polarization In Addition To Geometrical (Out-Of-Plane) Polarization Of The Ring Due To The Liquid Environment. This Facilitates Bending Of The Ring Along The Axis Passing Through Nitrogen Atoms. The Average Bending Angle Depends Largely On The Alkyl Chain Length And Slightly On The Anion Type. Redistribution Of Electron Density Over The Ring Caused By The Electron Donating Alkyl Group Provides Additional Independent Evidence To The Instability Of Lattice Structure, Hence The Low Melting Point Of The Ionic Liquid.

This System Is A Model For Many Other Trivalent Metal Halides And For Examining How The Network Structure Of The Pure Melts Is Broken Down By The Addition Of Alkali Halides With Different Structure-Breaking Powers. The Results Suggest A Way Of Reconciling The Conclusions Of Raman Studies About The Structures Of The Melts With Those Of Neutron And X-Ray-Diffraction Studies, Which Have Already Been Examined With The Same Simulation Methods. The Raman Spectra, Both Polarized And Depolarized, Are Calculated From A Model For The Dependence Of The Polarizability Of The System On The Ionic Coordinates Which Was Inspired By Electronic Structure Calculations Of The Polarizabilities Of Ions In A Condensed Phase Environment.

%  Abstract                 = {The surface, phase and aggregation behaviour of mixtures of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium halide, [Cnmim]X, where n is the alkyl chain length, with water has been explored using a variety of methods. Critical micelle concentrations (cmc) and micelle structures have been determined for aqueous [Cnmim]Br solutions for n=2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements reveal that for the n=8 and 10 systems, at concentrations just above the cmc, small near-spherical aggregates exist, which, after initial growth, possess core radii (aggregation numbers) at intermediate concentrations of (22?2) and (40?3), respectively, for n=8 and n=10. Towards higher concentrations, the aggregates appear to grow, with the aggregates in the [C10mim]Br system becoming increasingly elongated (prolate) with increasing concentration. No evident aggregates are formed in the systems with n=2 and 4. In the n=6 system, it appears that oblate aggregates with radius ~9 ? form at the cmc and that the radius increases with increasing concentration. For longer alkyl chain lengths, at high concentrations lyotropic mesophases form in some systems. The mesophase region for the [C8mim]Cl system has been explored across the composition range using X-ray diffraction and 2H NMR spectroscopy. Both techniques suggest that a major hexagonal phase with lattice parameter of coexists with a minor lamellar phase or possibly a second hexagonal phase . The area per adsorbed molecule at the surface of [C8mim]Br solutions has been measured as a function of concentration using neutron reflectometry. A minimum in the area per molecule behaviour is coincident with a minimum identified in the surface tension isotherm occurring close to the cmc. The data suggest depletion of [C8mim]Br from the surface region occurs at concentrations immediately above the cmc.},

The non-volatility, good solvent properties and high electrochemical stability of ionic liquids make them attractive solvents in contrast to volatile organic solvents. Despite this, the relatively high viscosity of ionic liquids leads to mass-transport limitations. Here we review recent developments in the application of different ionic liquids as solvents or components of liquid and quasi-solid electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells.},

%  Abstract                 = {The effect of adding primary n-alcohols with aliphatic chains and hexane on the nanostructure of a series of 14 protic ionic liquids (PILs) was explored using small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS). PILs were investigated with primary{,} secondary and tertiary ammonium cations containing different alkyl chain lengths{,} with and without hydroxyl substitution of the alkyl chain. Formate or nitrate anions were paired with these cations. The PILs which had no identified intermediate range order between 5-16 A had very low solubilities of the solutes. The other PILs{,} which had non-polar domains present{,} were mostly miscible with the primary alcohols of ethanol{,} propanol and butanol. When the alkyl chain length of the alcohols was similar to the PILs then the alcohols co-partitioned with the alkylammonium cation components of the PILs and caused either an increase or decrease in the size of the non-polar domains{,} depending on whether the alcohol chain length was longer or shorter than that of the cation in the PIL respectively. For ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) with propanol or butanol and propylammonium nitrate (PAN) with butanol{,} the difference between the alcohol chain length and the alkyl chain length was too great to lead to a modified nanostructure{,} and instead large aggregates were present. The solubility of hexane in the alkylammonium nitrate PILs had a very strong correlation to the alkyl chain length. The addition of hexane had very little effect on the non-polar domain sizes{,} which was attributed to it not being orientated in alignment with the alkylammonium cations in the non-polar domains. Lastly{,} seven binary PIL-PIL solution series were investigated using SAXS and WAXS to show how the nanostructure of these systems can be fine tuned to control the size and structure of the non-polar domains.},

%  Abstract                 = {Abstract Fluorous protic ionic liquids (FPILs) which consist of a hydrocarbon cation and fluorocarbon anion can possess a complex liquid nanostructure, consisting of segregated polar, hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon domains. \{FPILs\} are an interesting series of compounds of relevence to the fields of ionic liquids (Ils), fluorinated amphiphiles and mixed hydrocarbon/fluorocarbon amphiphile systems. Here we show the self-assembly of \{FPIL\} ethylammonium perfluorooctanoate (EOAF)â¤?water solutions, which transitions from a low water content \{L3\} sponge structure in EOAF, to a LÎ± lamellar mesophase and then to dispersed lamellar vesicles. The robust lamellar mesophase was present between 10 and 85&#xa0;wt.% EAOF, and retained up to 91&#xa0;Â°C. This phase underwent significant swelling on addition of water. In contrast, the addition of water to the hydrocarbon analogue, ethylammonium octanoate (EAO) swelled the sponge-like liquid nanostructure, with no other lyotropic liquid crystal mesophases observed. },

Radiolysis of the ionic liquid leads to formation of dry electrons and solvated electrons, which are scavenged by H3O+ to produce H-. atoms. Hydrogen atoms react very rapidly with pyrene (3.8 x 10(9) L mol(-1) s(-1)) and phenanthrene (2.9 x 10(9) L mol(-1) s(-1)) to form H-adduct radicals with sharp absorption peaks at 405 and 395 nm, respectively. They also react with benzophenone to form ring adducts, but the reaction is much slower. By competition kinetics with pyrene, the rate constants for reactions of H-. atoms with 2-PrOH and with crotonic acid were estimated to be approximate to6 x 10(7) and 4.6 x 10(9) L mol(-1) s(-1), respectively. All the rate constants, except for benzophenone, are similar to the values measured or estimated for the same reactions in aqueous solutions. The reactions with the aromatic hydrocarbons must be diffusion-controlled but are faster than diffusion-controlled reactions for solvated electrons in the same ionic liquid.},

Is G/Cm(3), And Rho(C)=325 Bar. The Electrical Conductivity Of Our Simulated Molten Salt Is Then Evaluated Along The Coexistence Curve, In The Highly Compressed Liquid And In The Dilute Gas. No Evidence For An Insulator-Ionic Conductor Transition Is Found. Instead A Continuous Transition Between A Highly Conducting Fluid At High Density And A Low Conducting Gas At Low Temperature Is Pointed Out. The Degree Of Dissociation Is Obtained From The Conductivity Data And From The Knowledge Of The Self-Diffusion Coefficients Through A Generalized Nernst-Einstein Relation. The Evolution Of The Degree Of Dissociation With Density And Temperature Is Corroborated By The Analysis Of The Charge-Charge Distribution Functions Which Show The Occurrence Of Ion Pairing At Low Density And Low Temperature. Finally, The Mean Field Type Behavior Exhibited By Our Simulated Molten Salt Is Discussed In Perspective With The Available Experimental Data For Other Fused Salts As Well As With The Current State Of The Theory Concerning The Criticality In Ionic Fluids.},

In studying a homologous series of N-alkyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide{,} [CnMPy][Tf2N] RTILs of varying alkyl chain length (n = 3{,} 4{,} 6{,} 8{,} and 10){,} biphasic rhodamine 6G solute diffusion dynamics were observed; both the fast and slow diffusion coefficients decreased with increasing alkyl chain length{,} with the relative contribution from slower diffusion increasing for longer-chain [CnMPy][Tf2N]. We propose that the biphasic diffusion dynamics originate from self-aggregation of the nonpolar alkyl chains in the cationic [CnMPy]+.},

%  Abstract                 = {A computational approach to the prediction of the heats of formation (??Hf??'s) of solid-state energetic salts from electronic structure and volume-based thermodynamics (VBT) calculations is described. The method uses as its starting point reliable ??Hf??'s for energetic precursor molecules and ions. The ??Hf??'s of more complex energetics species such as substituted imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole, and tetrazole molecules and ions containing amino, azido, and nitro (including methyl) substituents are calculated using an isodesmic approach at the MP2/complete basis set level. On the basis of comparisons to experimental data for neutral analogues, this isodesmic approach is accurate to <3 kcal/mol for the predicted cation and anion ??Hf??'s. The ??Hf??'s of the energetic salts in the solid state are derived from lattice energy (UL) calculations using a VBT approach. Improved values for the ?? and ?? parameters of 19.9 (kcal nm)/mol and 37.6 kcal/mol for the UL equation were obtained on the basis of comparisons to experimental UL's for a series of 23 salts containing ammonium, alkylammonium, and hydrazinium cations. The total volumes are adjusted to account for differences between predicted and experimental total volumes due to different shapes of the ions (flat vs spherical). The predicted ??Hf??'s of the energetic salts are estimated to have error bars of 6???7 kcal/mol, on the basis of comparisons to established experimental ??Hf??'s of a subset of the salts studied. Energetic salts with the highest positive ??Hf??'s are predicted for azido-containing cations, coupled with heterocyclic anions containing nitro substituents. The substitution of functional groups on carbon versus nitrogen atoms of the heterocyclic cations has interesting stabilization and destabilization effects, respectively.},

%  Abstract                 = {Molecular Dynamics Simulations Have Been Performed To Study The Complex And Heterogeneous Dynamics Of Ions In Ionic Liquids. The Dynamics Of Cations And Anions In 1-Ethyl-3-Methyl Imidazolium Nitrate (Emim-No3) Are Characterized By Van Hove Functions And The Corresponding Intermediate Scattering Functions F-S(K,T) And Elucidated By The Trajectories Augmented By The Use Of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Several Time Regions Are Found In The Mean Squared Displacement Of The Ions. Change In The Slope In A Plot Of The Diffusion Coefficient Against Temperature Is Found At Around 410 K In The Simulation. Heterogeneous Dynamics With The Presence Of Both Localized Ions And Fast Ions Capable Of Successive Jumps Were Observed At Long Time Scales In The Self-Part Of The Van Hove Functions And In The Trajectories. Non-Gaussian Dynamics Are Evidenced By The Self-Part Of The Van Hove Functions And Wave Number Dependence Of F-S(K,T) And Characterized As Levy Flights. Successive Motion Of Some Ions Can Continue Even After Several Nanoseconds At 370 K, Which Is Longer Than The Onset Time Of Diffusive Motion, T(Dif). Structure Of The Long Time Dynamics Of Fast Ions Is Clarified By The Phase Space Plot Of The Successive Motion Using The Denoised Data By Ssa. The Continual Dynamics Are Shown To Have A Long Term Memory, And Therefore Local Structure Is Not Enough To Explain The Heterogeneity. The Motion Connecting Localized Regions At About 370 K Is Jumplike, But There Is No Typical One Due To Local Structural Changes During Jump Motion. With The Local Motion, Mutual Diffusion Between Cation And Anion Occurs. On Decreasing Temperature, Mutual Diffusion Is Suppressed, Which Results In Slowing Down Of The Dynamics. This ``Mixing Effect Of Cation And Anion{''} Is Compared With The ``Mixed Alkali Effect{''} Found In The Ionics In The Ionically Conducting Glasses, Where The Interception Of Paths By Different Alkali Metal Ions Causes The Large Reduction In The Dynamics {[}J. Habasaki And K. L. Ngai, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 9, 4673 (2007), And References Herein]. Although A Similar Mechanism Of The Slowing Down Is Observed, Strong Coupling Of The Motion Of Cation And Anion Prevents Complete Interception Unless Deeply Supercooled, And This Explains The Wide Temperature Region Of The Existence Of The Liquid And Supercooled Liquid States In The Ionic Liquid.},

%  Abstract                 = {Detector systems introduce distortions into acquired data. To obtain accurate angle and intensity information, it is necessary to calibrate, and apply corrections. Intensify non-linearity, spatial distortion, and non-uniformity of intensity response, are the primary considerations. It is better to account for the distortions within scientific analysis software, but often it is more practical to correct the distortions to produce `idealised' data. Calibration methods and software have been developed for single crystal diffraction experiments, using both approaches. For powder diffraction experiments;the additional task of converting a two-dimensional image to a one-dimensional spectrum is used to allow Rietveld analysis. This task may be combined with distortion correction to produce intensify information and error estimates. High-pressure experiments can introduce additional complications and place new demands on software. Flexibility is needed to be able to integrate different angular regions separately, and to produce profiles as a function of angle of azimuth. Methods to cope with awkward data are described, and examples of the techniques applied to data from high pressure experiments are presented.},

The electrolyte exhibited high ionic conductivity comparable to that of a conventional organic electrolyte. \{EDLC\} prepared with EMI-FSI showed excellent rate capability although the electrolyte is a neat ionic liquid; this performance was observed irrespective of the presence of a binder in an activated carbon-based electrode. The self-discharge was suppressed by using EMI-FSI. A cycling durability test showed that the cell with EMI-FSI kept over 90% of the initial capacitance even after 10,000 cycles. },

Experimental neutron scattering combined with empirical potential structure refinement analysis of the data and classical molecular dynamics simulations have been used to probe the liquid structure in detail. Both techniques generated highly consistent results that provide valuable validation of the force fields and refinement approaches. A significant degree of apparent charge ordering is found in the liquid structure, although the nonspherical shape of the ions results in interpenetration of cations into the first shell of adjacent cations, with much shorter closest contact distances than the averaged center-of-mass cation-cation and cation-anion separations.},

The Stokes-Einstein Number N Is Viscosity Dependent: Ln N=Const+(T-1)Ln Eta. Molecular And Ionic Liquids For Which High-Pressure Transport Property Data Are Available In The Literature Are Shown To Exhibit The Same Behavior With 0.79 < T < 1. Water Is Also Shown To Fit The Fse At Atmospheric Pressure, With A Change In Exponent T From 0.94 To 0.67 At About 258 K (265 K For D2O), But The FSE Holds Only Approximately At High Pressures. It Sometimes Argued That Fse In Supercooled Liquids Near The Glass Transition Is A Diagnostic For Dynamic Heterogeneity, But This Work Shows That The Fse Holds In Normal Liquids Far From The Glass Transition. This Result May Provide A Reference For Complex Liquids Such As Viscous Glass Formers That Show A Transition (Dynamic Crossover) In The Temperature Dependence Of The Viscosity And Network-Bonded Liquids Such As Water.},

Here We Examine How These Methods Fare When Used To Calculate The Cross Section For Photon Absorption By A Quantum System Imbedded In A Medium. To Test The Method, We Study A Model Which Has Two Degrees Of Freedom And Mimicks The Properties Of A One-Dimensional Alkali Atom-He Dimer. We Treat The Electron Motion Quantum Mechanically And The Distance Between The He Atom And The Alkali Ion Classically. Light Absorption Occurs Because The Electron Is Coupled To Radiation. The Calculation Of The Absorption Cross Section By Quantum-Classical Methods Fails Rather Dramatically-At Certain Frequencies, The Absorption Coefficient Is Negative. By Comparing With Exact Quantum Calculations, We Show That This Failure Takes Place Because The Time Evolution Of The Classical Variables Influences The Dynamics Of The Quantum Degree Of Freedom Through The Hamiltonian Only; Important Information, Which A Fully Quantum Treatment Would Put In The Wave Function, Is Missing. To Repair This Flaw, We Experiment With A Method Which Uses A Swarm Of Classical Trajectories To Generate A ``Classical Wave Function.{''} The Results Are Encouraging, But Require Substantial Computer Time When The Number Of Classical Variables Is Large. We Argue That In The Limit Of Many Classical Degrees Of Freedom, Accurate Calculations Can Be Performed By Using The Time-Dependent Hartree Method And Treating Some Degrees Of Freedom By Exact Numerical Methods (E.G., A Fast Fourier Transform Procedure) And The Others By Gaussian Wave Packets Or Any Other Propagation Method That Is Accurate For A Very Short Time. This Procedure Leads To A Simple Time Domain Picture Of Dephasing And Line Broadening In The Case Of A Localized Quantum System Imbedded In A Medium With Heavy Atoms.},

%  Abstract                 = {Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) are attracting considerable research interest as replacements for traditional molecular solvents in a diverse range of chemical applications, mostly due to their green characteristics and remarkable physical properties. Previously, we reported the liquid structure of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate confined between mica and an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip, and found that approximately three solvation layers form. In this manuscript, we present new data, derived from similar experiments, for three different aprotic ILs [1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorphosphate (BMIm PF6), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (EMIm TSFA), and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (BMP TSFA)] and between five and six solvation layers are identified depending on the IL species. These new results allow us to make suggestions for molecularly designing TL architectures likely to be suitable for a particular application, depending on whether near surface order is desirable or not. Where mobility of component ions and transfer of species to and from the interface is required (DSSCs, hetereogencous catalysis, etc.), multiple sterically hindered allylic functional groups could be incorporated to minimize substrate-IL interactions and maximize compressibility of the solvation layers. Conversely, in situations where IL adsorption to the interface is desirable (e.g., lubrication or electrode surface restructuring), symmetric ions with localized charge centers are preferable.},

Atomic detail on the ion arrangements around the propylammonium cation and nitrate anion yields evidence of hydrogen bonding between ammonium and nitrate groups and of strong alkyl chain aggregation and interdigitation.

%  Abstract                 = {We report a new way of developing ion gels through the self-assembly of a triblock copolymer in a room-temperature ionic liquid. Transparent ion gels were achieved by gelation of a poly(styrene-block-ethylene oxide-block-styrene) (SOS) triblock copolymer in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF6]) with as low as 5 wt % SOS triblock copolymer. The gelation behavior, ionic conductivity, rheological properties, and microstructure of the ion gels were investigated. The ionic conductivity of the ion gels is only modestly affected by the triblock copolymer network. Its temperature dependence nearly tracks that of the bulk ionic liquid viscosity. The ion gels are thermally stable up to at least 100 ??C and possess significant mechanical strength. The results presented here suggest that triblock copolymer gelation is a promising way to develop highly conductive ion gels and provides many advantages in terms of variety and processing.},

%  Abstract                 = {A multistate empirical valence bond (MS-EVB) model is developed to simulate proton transport in liquid imidazole. This approach allows proton transfer to simultaneously occur on both reaction sites (donor and acceptor) of the imidazole molecule. The underlying imidazole and imidazolium models are described by the generalized Amber force field (GAFF). The imidazole MS-EVB model was parametrized to reproduce the ab initio proton shuttling potential energy surface (PES) of a protonated imidazole dimer in the gas phase. In bulk phase at 393 K, the MS-EVB simulation yields a proton diffusion coefficient of 0.20 angstrom(2)/ps and a Grotthuss hopping rate of 1/36 ps(-1). Both results are in good agreement with experimental results. Despite the prevalence of a classical-like imidazolium structure with highly localized protonic charge, charge delocalization is not a negligible process in the simulations. Rather, it is shown to enhance the rate of proton diffusion by approximately 40\% through Grotthuss shuttling. Analysis of the EVB states reveals that the imidazolium ion's first solvation shell by imidazole molecules is highly ordered through the formation of hydrogen bonds, while the second solvation shell is highly disordered. Together with the importance of charge delocalization, this result suggests that reorientation of imidazole rings in the second solvation shell is the rate-limiting step for proton transfer.},

The crystal structure of PIP12TFSI has been determined at 123 K. The salt crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 with Z = 8. Structural data are also reported for PYR11TFSI at 153 K and PIP12TFSI at 223 K. PIP11TFSI has identical ion crystal packing to the analogous pyrrolidinium salt PYR11TFSI. Since increasing the cation alkyl chain length to propyl or butyl (R = 3 or 4) reduces the melting point of the salts below room temperature, this study may provide valuable insight into why these pyrrolidinium and piperidinium salts form room-temperature ionic liquids.},

%  Abstract                 = {In this work, we investigate the slow dynamics of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, a very popular room-temperature ionic solvent. Our study predicts the existence of heterogeneity in the liquid and shows that this heterogeneity is the underlying microscopic cause for the recently reported "red-edge effect" (REE) observed in the study of fluorescence of the organic probe 2-amino-7-nitrofluorene. This theoretical work explains in microscopic terms the relation between REE and dynamic heterogeneity in a room-temperature ionic liquid (IL). The REE is typical of micellar or colloidal systems, which are characterized by microscopic environments that are structurally very different. In contrast, in the case of this room-temperature IL, the REE occurs because of the long period during which molecules are trapped in quasistatic local solvent cages. This trapping time, which is longer than the lifetime of the excited-state probe, together with the inability of the surroundings to adiabatically relax, induces a set of site-specific spectroscopic responses. Subensembles of fluorescent molecules associated with particular local environments absorb and emit at different frequencies. We describe in detail the absorption wavelength-dependent emission spectra of 2-amino-7-nitrofluorene and show that this dependence on lambda(ex) is characteristic of the IL and, as is to be expected, is absent in the case of a normal solvent such as methanol.},

The probability of the gauche defect per CH2???CH2 bond in the alkyl chain decreases as the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain increases. This observation suggests that the interaction between the alkyl chains is enhanced as the alkyl chain length becomes longer. The frequencies of the C???H stretching vibrational modes observed in the SFG spectra are higher than those of the corresponding peak positions observed in the infrared spectra of the bulk liquids. This shift is consistent with a structure in which the alkyl chain protrudes from the bulk liquid into the air. A local structure, which originates from the intermolecular interaction between the ionic liquid molecules, is proposed to explain these observations.},

The IL is a hydrophilic ionic liquid, N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-2-methoxyethyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate, [DEME][BF4]. At a small amount of the above additional molecules in the IL, the conventional preferred orientation on the Debye rings was seen by the X-ray diffraction. At 0.9 mol % H2O, twinlike crystal domains develop extraordinary on the microdomains. By the ???crystal-growth enhancement effect??? at a slight amount of water, a composite domain structure, which consists of the large domain and the weakly orientated microdomains, is formed without internal strains. Above 2.9 mol % H2O, the domain structure, however, disappears completely. It is remarkable that, in a thermal cycling experiment using pure [DEME][BF4], the similar composite domain structure appeared. This is also caused by an uptake of a slight amount of water.},

None of these liquids display a prominent ultrafast solvation component comparable to the one observed in imidizalium ionic liquids. The solvation dynamics observed on the nanosecond time scale are also 5-fold slower than those in imidazolium liquids of comparable viscosities. Both rotation and solvation are highly nonexponential functions of time and can be represented by stretched-exponential decays with exponents near 0.5. Characteristic times of these processes track solvent viscosity. A number of similarities between the dynamics observed in these ionic liquids and supercooled glass-forming liquids are noted. },

%  Abstract                 = {Time-resolved phosphorescence spectra and anisotropy of quinoxaline were measured in an ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIM-HFP), in its supercooled state near the glass-transition temperature. The solvation dynamics results are compared with the rotational motion of the probe and with the dielectric behavior of the neat ionic liquid. The dynamics in the viscous state are highly dispersive and show a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as typical for glass-forming materials. Combined with room-temperature results, solvation dynamics is observed to follow the structural relaxation times in terms of ??/T for more than 10 decades, from subnanoseconds at room temperature to seconds near the glass-transition temperature Tg. The dielectric modulus relaxation follows this trend only for temperatures T > 1.2Tg and departs significantly from ??/T in the 1.1Tg > T > Tg range. This deviation is reminiscent of the enhanced translational diffusion or fractional Stokes???Einstein behavior observed in many fragile supercooled liquids. Because the electric field relaxation in BMIM-HFP includes dc conductivity, this correlation function involves translational motion and thus displays the effect of enhanced diffusivity. A microscopic model is required for rationalizing the decoupling of solvation dynamics from the longitudinal time scales and the limitation of this effect to the viscous regime with T < 1.2Tg.},

%  Abstract                 = {A short-range effective potential for long-range electrostatic interactions in homogeneously disordered condensed phase systems has been determined with a novel approach to coarse-graining in interaction space. As opposed to coarse-graining the system resolution, this approach ``coarsens{''} the system's interactions by mapping multiple configurations of an accurate long-range atomistic potential onto a more efficient, short-range effective potential with a force-matching (FM) method. Developing an empirical potential in this manner is fundamentally different from existing strategies because it utilizes condensed-phase (as opposed to gas-phase) atomistic interactions to determine general pair potentials defined on distance meshes (as opposed to fitting predetermined functional forms). The resulting short-range (similar to 10 angstrom) effective potential reproduces structural, dynamical, and many thermodynamic properties of liquid water, ions in water, and hydrophobes in water, with unprecedented accuracy. The effective potential is also shown to be transferable to a nonaqueous molten salt system. With continued development, such effective potentials may provide an accurate and highly efficient alternative to Ewald-based long-range electrostatics methods.},

%  Abstract                 = {The prediction of molar volumes and densities of several ionic liquids has been achieved using a group contribution model as a function of temperature between (273 and 423) K at atmospheric pressure. It was observed that the calculation of molar volumes or densities could be performed using the ?¤?ideal?¤? behavior of the molar volumes of mixtures of ionic liquids. This model is based on the observations of Canongia Lopes et al. (J. Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109, 3519?¤?3525) which showed that this ideal behavior is independent of the temperature and allows the molar volume of a given ionic liquid to be calculated by the sum of the effective molar volume of the component ions. Using this assumption, the effective molar volumes of ions constituting more than 220 different ionic liquids were calculated as a function of the temperature at 0.1 MPa using more than 2150 data points. These calculated results were used to build up a group contribution model for the calculation of ionic liquid molar volumes and densities with an estimated repeatability and uncertainty of 0.36 % and 0.48 %, respectively. The impact of impurities (water and halide content) in ionic liquids as well as the method of determination were also analyzed and quantified to estimate the overall uncertainty.},

The Computed Melting Point Of The Orthorhombic Phase Ranges From 365 To 369 K, Depending On The Classical Force Field Used. This Compares Reasonably Well With The Experimental Values, Which Range From 337 To 339 K. The Computed Enthalpy Of Fusion Ranges From 19 To 29 Kj/Mol, Compared To The Experimental Values Of 18.5-21.5 Kj/Mol. Only One Of The Two Force Fields Evaluated In This Work Yielded A Stable Monoclinic Phase, Despite The Fact That Both Give Accurate Liquid State Densities. The Computed Melting Point Of The Monoclinic Polymorph Was Found To Be 373 K, Which Is Somewhat Higher Than The Experimental Range Of 318-340 K. The Computed Enthalpy Of Fusion Was 23 Kj/Mol, Which Is Also Higher Than The Experimental Value Of 9.3-14.5 Kj/Mol. The Simulations Predict That The Monoclinic Form Is More Stable Than The Orthorhombic Form At Low Temperature, In Agreement With One Set Of Experiments But In Conflict With Another. The Difference In Free Energy Between The Two Polymorphs Is Very Small, Due To The Fact That A Single Trans-Gauche Conformational Difference In An Alkyl Sidechain Distinguishes The Two Structures. As A Result, It Is Very Difficult To Construct Simple Classical Force Fields That Are Accurate Enough To Definitively Predict Which Polymorph Is Most Stable. A Liquid Phase Analysis Of The Probability Distribution Of The Dihedral Angles In The Alkyl Chain Indicates That Less Than Half Of The Dihedral Angles Are In The Gauche-Trans Configuration That Is Adopted In The Orthorhombic Crystal. The Low Melting Point And Glass Forming Tendency Of This Ionic Liquid Is Likely Due To The Energy Barrier For Conversion Of The Remaining Dihedral Angles Into The Gauche-Trans State. The Simulation Procedure Used To Perform The Melting Point Calculations Is An Extension Of The So-Called Pseudosupercritical Path Sampling Procedure. This Study Demonstrates That The Method Can Be Effectively Applied To Quite Complex Systems Such As Ionic Liquids And That The Appropriate Choice Of Tethering Potentials For A Key Step In The Thermodynamic Path Can Enable First Order Phase Transitions To Be Avoided.},

A valence-bond description is employed to account for the instantaneous adjustment of the solute electronic charge distribution to the fluctuating solvent environment. It is found that the ultrafast inertial component of solvation dynamics becomes slower as the solute polarizability grows. Moreover, its contribution to overall solvent relaxation becomes reduced with increasing polarizability, especially in the case of nonequilibrium solvation dynamics. Overall, the inclusion of the solute electronic polarizability in the simulations improves the agreement with time-dependent Stokes shift measurements.},

The results imply a topological short-range order increase represented by a small collective rearrangement of atoms including the nearest neighbours without a long-distance diffusion. The excess free volume disappears at the same time. A more detailed analysis based on the decomposition of two radial distribution functions into Gaussians has shown that the complexes of two or more icosahedra connected through a common vertex with Ti atoms in their centres are present in the as-quenched structure. During the relaxation annealing these complexes decompose into isolated and more regularly shaped icosahedra. The conclusions are supported by the changes of a prepeak which is present in the interference functions.},

Evolution of the polar network, water network, and micelle structures is visualized and analyzed via partial radial distribution functions. The calculated static partial structure factors show that within the range of water contents examined, polar networks, water networks, and micelles possess an approximately invariant characteristic length at around 20 ??. Furthermore, the above calculations point out that, as the amount of water increases, the polar network is continuously broken up (screened) by the intruding water, while the structural organization of the water network and the micelle exhibits a turnover. At the turnover point, the most ordered micelle (cation???cation) structure and water (water???anion???water) network are formed. Thereafter, the structural organization abates drastically, and only loose micelle structure exists due to the dominant water???water interactions. The simulated turnover of structural organization agrees with the sharpest peak in the experimentally obtained structure factor in aqueous solutions of similar ionic liquids; the simulated water structure reveals that water can form liquidlike associated aggregates due to the planar symmetry and strong basicity of NO3-, in agreement with experiment. The turnover of structural organization of micelles results from the persistent competition between the hydrophobic interactions of the nonpolar groups and the breakup of the charged polar network with increasing water content, whereas the turnover of the water network results from the competition between the water???water and water???anion interactions.},

%  Abstract                 = {Multiscale coarse-grained (MS-CG) molecular dynamics simulations were performed for the liquid-vacuum interface of room-temperature ionic liquids having alkyl substituents of different lengths. Surface properties, such as the number density profile, the orientational ordering, and surface tension, were calculated. Both CG site and electron number density profiles show that, for the ionic liquids with a long enough alkyl chain, a unique multilayer ordering occurs. In contrast, ionic liquids with a shorter chain exhibit an interfacial structure consistent with a monolayer ordering. Detailed analysis indicates that such mono/multilayer ordering results from the strong electrostatic interactions among the polar groups, and the collective short-range interactions among the nonpolar groups. Such surface behavior may be interpreted as the two-dimensional manifestation of bulk spatial heterogeneity in ionic liquids (Wang, Y.; both, G. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 12192). The orientational behavior of the cation shows that the alkyl chain tends to align parallel to the surface normal, while the aromatic ring is preferentially perpendicular to the surface normal for all the underlying species. An analysis for the surface electron density demonstrates that the cation plays a key role in determining the surface electron density oscillations, while the anion only marginally affects the enhancement. The surface tension is seen to monotonically decrease and approaches a constant as the chain length increases, in agreement with Langmuir theory and experiments.},

%  Abstract                 = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed to investigate the structure and dynamics of an energetic ionic liquid, 1-hydroxyethyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium nitrate (HEATN). The generalized amber force field (GAFF) was used, and an electronically polarizable model was further developed in the spirit of our previous work (Yan, T.; Burnham, C.J.; Del Popolo, M. G.; Voth, G. A. J. Phys. Chem. B 2004,108,11877). In. the process of simulated annealing from a liquid state at 475 K down to a glassy state at 175 K, the MD simulations identify a glass-transition temperature region at around 250-275 K, in agreement with experiment. The self-intermediate scattering functions show vanishing boson peaks in the supercooled region, indicating that HEATN may be a fragile glass former. The coupling/decoupling of translational and reorientational ion motion is also discussed, and various other physical properties of the liquid state are intensively studied at 400 K. A complex hydrogen bond network was revealed with the calculation of partial radial distribution functions. When compared to the similarly sized 1-ethyl-4-methyl-1,4-imidazolium nitrate ionic liquid, EMIM+/NO3, a hydrogen bond network directly resulting in the poorer packing efficiency of ions is observed, which is responsible for the lower melting/glass-transition point. The structural properties of the liquid/vacuum interface shows that there is vanishing layering at the interface, in accordance with the poor ion packing. The effects of electronic polarization on the self-diffusion, viscosity, and surface tension of HEATN are found to be significant, in agreement with an earlier study on EMIM+/NO3-.},

The solute kinetics examined here include rotation and solvation of coumarin 153, isomerization of two malononitriles, and intramolecular charge transfer in crystal violet lactone. The rates of most of these processes vary significantly with excitation wavelength, especially for excitation on the red edges of the solute absorption bands, indicating that energetically selected subpopulations relax at distinct rates. The results presented here suggest more generally that dynamical processes taking place on the subnanosecond time scale in typical ionic liquids near room temperature are likely to be heterogeneous in character.},

Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

Heat capacities of the crystal, glass, and liquid phases for [C4mim][PF6] were measured with a pair of calorimeters. A vacuum-jacketed adiabatic calorimeter was used at temperatures between (5 and 310) K, and a heat bridge-scanning calorimeter was used from (300 to 550) K. With the adiabatic calorimeter, the fusion Tfus = 283.51 K, = 19.60 kJ.mol-1, and the glass transition Tg = 190.6 K were observed. The [C4mim][PF6] test sample was determined to have a mole fraction purity of 0.9956 by a fractional melting analysis. Densities of the liquid were measured in a range of temperatures from (298 to 353) K with a pycnometer equipped with a capillary neck. An unexpected endothermal transition, with a very small enthalpy change of 0.25 J.g-1 (0.071 kJ.mol-1), was observed in a range of temperatures from (394 to 412) K. Heat capacity jumps were determined at the glass transition Cs = 81.6 J.K-1.mol-1 and fusion Cs = 44.8 J.K-1.mol-1, and the observed entropy change at fusion is S (283.51 K) = 69.23 J.K-1.mol-1.},

As in many other room-temperature ionic liquids three characteristic intermolecular peaks can be detected in the structure function S(q). A prepeak or first sharp diffraction peak is observed at about q = 0.42 A-1. Long range anion-anion correlations are the most important contributors to this peak. In all systems we have studied to date{,} this prepeak is a signature of solvation asymmetry. The peak in S(q) near q = 0.75 A-1 is the signature of ionic alternation and arises from the charge ordered separation of ions of the same charge. The most intense diffraction peak near q = 1.37 A-1 arises from short-range separation between ions of opposite charge combined with a significant contribution from cationic carbon-carbon interactions{,} indicating that cationic hydrophobic tails have significant contacts.},

The radial distribution function obtained by WAXS shows prominent peaks ascribable to a structure constructed by iodide anions; this means that the structure of the anions has a long-range correlation. The Raman spectrum of liquid [bmim]I agrees with those of [bmim]Cl and [bmim]Br in the molten phase and in crystals. The results show that the cation structures in the liquids of three [bmim] halides are similar to those in the crystals. However, the arrangement of the iodide anions in liquid [bmim]I differs slightly from those in crystalline [bmim]Cl and [bmim]Br, although it partly retains the hydrophilic channel structure characteristic of the crystals.},

%  Abstract                 = {Atomistic simulations are conducted to examine the dependence of the viscosity of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide on temperature and water content. A nonequilibrium molecular dynamics procedure is utilized along with an established fixed charge force field. It is found that the simulations quantitatively capture the temperature dependence of the viscosity as well as the drop in viscosity that occurs with increasing water content. Using mixture viscosity models, we show that the relative drop in viscosity with water content is actually less than that that would be predicted for an ideal system. This finding is at odds with the popular notion that small amounts of water cause an unusually large drop in the viscosity of ionic liquids. The simulations suggest that, due to preferential association of water with anions and the formation of water clusters, the excess molar volume is negative. This means that dissolved water is actually less effective at lowering the viscosity of these mixtures when compared to a solute obeying ideal mixing behavior. The use of a nonequilibrium simulation technique enables diffusive behavior to be observed on the time scale of the simulations, and standard equilibrium molecular dynamics resulted in sub-diffusive behavior even over 2 ns of simulation time.},

We Have Analyzed The Form Of The Time Correlation Function Of Vibrational Dephasing And Determined The Type Of Modulation Events, Which Cause The Line Broadening Processes In These Systems; These Are Found To Be Purely Discrete Markovian. Within The Formalism Of The Purely Discrete Markovian Modulation, We Have Made A Judgement About Spectroscopically Active Interactions In These Systems.

%  Abstract                 = {Ionic liquids represent a novel and poorly understood class of solvents, and one challenge in understanding these systems is how one should view the electrostatic character of solute-??solvent interactions. The highly structured nature of a fused salt makes a dielectric continuum approximation difficult to implement, and there is no obvious connection between the structure of an individual ion and the polarization character of the medium. We address this problem by making the ansatz that rather than polarizing the medium, the solute may be viewed as intercalating in the charge distribution of the neat liquid such that the solvent screens the electric field of the solute. This approach allows derivation of an analytical expression for the distribution of solvent charge about the solute, and this distribution is found to be a close match to simulation data. The theory also predicts that the electrostatic character of solute???solvent interactions should be determined primarily by the number density of solvent ions, a prediction proven correct by analysis of existing experimental data. The approach represents a new model for the interpretation of solvation phenomena in ionic liquids.},

We Present The Results Of Molecular Dynamics Simulations Of The Solvation Dynamics Of The Ionic Liquid 1-Butyl-3-Methylimidazolium Hexafluorophosphate In Response To Photoexcitation Of The Fluorescent Dye Coumarin-153. We Reproduce The Time-Resolved Fluorescence Stokes Shift Using Linear Response Theory, Then Use Novel Statistical Techniques To Analyze Cation And Anion Contributions To The Signal. We Find That The Solvation Dynamics Are Dominated By Collective Ionic Motion And Characterize The Time Scale For Various Features Of The Collective Response. Further, We Use The Steele Analysis {[}Mol. Phys. 61, 1031 (1987)] To Characterize The Contributions To The Observed Stokes Shift Made By Translational And Rovibrational Degrees Of Freedom. Our Results Indicate That In Contrast To Molecular Liquids, The Rovibrational Response Is Trivial And The Observed Fluorescence Response Arises Almost Entirely From Ionic Translation. Our Results Resolve Previously Open Questions In The Literature About The Nature Of The Rapid Dynamics In Room-Temperature Ionic Liquids And Offer Insight Into The Physical Principles Governing Ionic Liquid Behavior On Longer Time Scales.},

%  Abstract                 = { We have investigated structure and relaxation phenomena for ionic liquids 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (C8mimPF6) and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (C8mimTFSI) by means of neutron diffraction and neutron spin echo (NSE) techniques. The diffraction patterns show two distinct peaks appeared at scattering vectors Q of 0.3 and 1.0 à?¥?à¥?¤?1. The former originates from the nanoscale structure characteristic to ionic liquids and the latter due to the interionic correlations. Interestingly, the intensity of the low-Q peak drastically grows upon cooling and keeps growing even below the glass transition temperature. The NSE measurements have been performed at these two Q positions, to explore the time evolution of each correlation. The relaxation related to the ionic correlation (ionic diffusion) is of Arrhenius-type and exhibits nonexponential behavior. The activation energy (Ea) of the ionic diffusion, which is linked to viscosity, depends on the type of anion; the larger is the anion size, the smaller Ea becomes for most of anions. On the other hand, two kinds of relaxation processes, slower and faster ones, are found at the low-Q peak position. The most significant finding is that the fraction of the slower relaxation increases and that of the faster one decreases upon cooling. Combining the NSE data with the diffraction data, we conclude that there exist two parts in ILs: one with the ordered nanostructure exhibiting the slow relaxation, and the other with disordered structure showing faster relaxation. The structure and dynamics of ILs are heterogeneous in nature, and the fraction of each part changes with temperature. },

A Reverse Monte Carlo Simulation Showed That The Average Number Of Atoms Per Chain Is 4.4. A Detailed Chain Analysis Of The Atomic Configuration Revealed That (Fh)(2)F- Oligomer Chains Are The Major Entities In The Liquid, And Asymmetrical Fhf- Are Formed Owing To The Strong H-F Hydrogen Bonds.

Linear Chain And Ring Aggregates Have Been Considered And Geometries Are Found To Be Comparable With Liquid Phase Structures. Cooperative Effects Occur When The Total Energy Of The Oligomer Differs From A Simple Sum Of Monomer Energies. Cooperative Effects Have Been Found In The Structural Motifs Examined. A Systematic Study Of Linear Chains Of Increasing Length (Up To Nine Monomer Units) Has Shown That Cooperativity Plays A More Important Role Than Expected And Is Stronger Than In Water. The Cl Center Dot Center Dot Center Dot H Distance Of The Chloride To The Most Acidic Proton Increases With An Increasing Number Of Monomer Units.

%  Abstract                 = {A Systematic Molecular Dynamics Study Is Performed To Determine The Dynamics And Transport Properties Of 12 Room-Temperature Ionic Liquids Family With 1-Alkyl-3-Methylimidazolium Cation, {[}Amim](+) (Alkyl=Methyl, Ethyl, Propyl, And Butyl), With Counterions, Pf6-, No3-, And Cl-. The Goal Of The Work Is To Provide Molecular Level Understanding Of The Transport Coefficients Of These Liquids As Guidance To Experimentalists On Choosing Anion And Cation Pairs To Match Required Properties Of Ionic Liquid Solvents. In The Earlier Paper (Part I), We Characterized The Dynamics Of Ionic Liquids And Provided A Detailed Comparison Of The Diffusion Coefficients For Each Ion Using The Einstein And Green-Kubo Formulas. In This Second Part, Other Transport Properties Of Imidazolium Salts Are Calculated, In Particular, The Electrical Conductivity Is Calculated From The Nernst-Einstein And Green-Kubo Formulas. The Viscosity Is Also Determined From The Stokes-Einstein Relation. The Results Of The Calculated Transport Coefficients Are Consistent With The Previous Computational And Experimental Studies Of Imidazolium Salts. Generally, The Simulations Give Electrical Conductivity Lower Than Experiment While The Viscosity Estimate Is Higher Than Experiment. Within The Same Cation Family, The Ionic Liquids With The No3- Counterion Have The Highest Electrical Conductivities: Sigma{[}No3](-)>Sigma{[}Pf6](-)>Sigma{[}Cl](-). The {[}Dmim]{[}X] Series, Due To Their Symmetric Cationic Structure And Good Packing And The {[}Bmim]{[}X] Series Due To Higher Inductive Van Der Waals Interactions Of {[}Bmim](+), Have The Highest Viscosities In These Ionic Liquid Series. Our Simulations Show That The Major Factors Determining The Magnitude Of The Self-Diffusion, Electrical Conductivity, And Viscosity Are The Geometric Shape, Ion Size, And The Delocalization Of The Ionic Charge In The Anion.},

%  Abstract                 = {Molecular Dynamics Simulations Are Used To Study The Dynamics And Transport Properties Of 12 Room-Temperature Ionic Liquids Of The 1-Alkyl-3-Methylimidazolium {[}Amim](+) (Alkyl=Methyl, Ethyl, Propyl, And Butyl) Family With Pf6-, No3-, And Cl- Counterions. The Explicit Atom Transferable Force Field Of Canongia Lopes Et Al. {[}J. Phys. Chem. B 108, 2038 (2004)] Is Used In The Simulations. In This First Part, The Dynamics Of The Ionic Liquids Are Characterized By Studying The Mean-Square Displacement (Msd) And The Velocity Autocorrelation Function (Vacf) For The Centers Of Mass Of The Ions At 400 K. Trajectory Averaging Was Employed To Evaluate The Diffusion Coefficients At Two Temperatures From The Linear Slope Of Msd(T) Functions In The Range Of 150-300 Ps And From The Integration Of The Vacf (T) Functions At 400 K. Detailed Comparisons Are Made Between The Diffusion Results From The Msd And Vacf Methods. The Diffusion Coefficients From The Integration Of The Vacfs Are Closer To Experimental Values Than The Diffusion Coefficients Calculated From The Slope Of Msds. Both Methods Can Show Good Agreement With Experiment In Predicting Relative Trends In The Diffusion Coefficients And Determining The Role Of The Cation And Anion Structures On The Dynamical Behavior Of This Family Of Ionic Liquids. The Msd And Self-Diffusion Of Relatively Heavier Imidazolium Cations Are Larger Than Those Of The Lighter Anions From The Einstein Results, Except For The Case Of {[}Bmim]{[}Cl]. The Cationic Transference Number Generally Decreases With Temperature, In Good Agreement With Experiments. For The Same Anion, The Cationic Transference Numbers Decrease With Increasing Length Of The Alkyl Chain, And For The Same Cation, The Trends In The Cationic Transference Numbers Are {[}No3](-)>{[}Cl](-)<{[}Pf6](-). The Trends In The Diffusion Coefficient In The Series Of Cations With Identical Anions Are {[}Emim](+)>{[}Pmim](+)>{[}Bmim](+) And Those For Anions With Identical Cations Are {[}No3](-)>{[}Pf6](-)>{[}Cl](-). The {[}Dmim](+) Has A Relatively Low Diffusion Coefficient Due To Its Symmetric Structure And Good Packing In The Liquid Phase. The Major Factor For Determining The Magnitude Of The Self-Diffusion Is The Geometric Shape Of The Anion Of The Ionic Liquid. Other Important Factors Are The Ion Size And The Charge Delocalization In The Anion. C 2008 American Institute Of Physics. {[}Doi: 10.1063/1.3035978]},

Nonlinear Integrodifferential Equations For The Time Evolution Of The Density-Fluctuations Autocorrelation Functions Are The Basic Input Of The Mode Coupling Theory. Restricting Ourselves To A Small Set Of Such Equations, We Fit The Numerical Solution To The Experimental Spectra. It Leads To A Good Agreement Between Model And Experiment, Which Allows Us To Determine How A Real System Explores The Parameter Space Of The Model, But It Also Leads To Unrealistic Effective Vertices In A Temperature Range Where The Theory Makes Critical Asymptotic Predictions. We Finally Discuss The Relevance And The Range Of Validity Of These Universal Asymptotic Predictions When Applied To Experimental Data On Supercooled Liquids.

The Comparison Between The Results Obtained With Mp2 And The Dft Approach Allows Us To Comment On The Validity Of This Latter And Thus On Its Employment In Larger Systems. On The Other Hand, The Comparison Between The Dft Results And Those Of The Classical Approach Allows Us To Test The Reproducibility Of Electrostatic Properties By This Latter Approach. As The Results Show The Used Dft Setup Is Rather Satisfactory, While The Classical Force Fields Are Describing The Electrostatic Properties In An Insufficient Way.

The most stable structures are covalent acid???base pairs for the monomers and ionic acid???base pairs for the dimers. The hydrogen-bonding distances are greater in the ionic dimers than in the covalent monomers, and the stretching frequencies are significantly different in the covalent and ionic clusters. The anharmonicity of the potential energy surfaces is found to influence the geometries, frequencies, and nuclear magnetic shielding constants for these systems. The inclusion of anharmonic effects significantly decreases many of the calculated vibrational frequencies in these clusters and improves the agreement of the calculated frequencies with the experimental data available for the isolated neutral species. The calculations of nuclear magnetic shielding constants for all nuclei in these clusters illustrate that quantitatively accurate predictions of nuclear magnetic shieldings for comparison to experimental data require the inclusion of anharmonic effects. These calculations of geometries, frequencies, and shielding constants provide insight into the significance of anharmonic effects in ionic materials and provide data that will be useful for the parametrization of molecular mechanical force fields for ionic liquids. Anharmonic effects will be particularly important for the study of proton transfer reactions in ionic materials.},

High-Pressure Infrared Spectral Profiles, X-Ray Crystallographic Analysis, And Ab Initio Calculations Allow Us To Make A Vibrational Assignment Of These Compounds. The Appearance Of A Signal For The Free-Nh Unit (Or Weakly Bonded N-H...F Unit) In The Infrared Spectrum Of The Pf6- Salt Indicates That Conventional N-H...O And N-H...N Hydrogen Bonds Do Not Fully Dominate The Packing. It Is Likely That The Charge-Enhanced C-2-H...F Interactions, Combined With Other Weak Hydrogen Bonds, Disturb The Formation Of N-H Hydrogen Bonds In The Pf6- Salt. This Finding Is Consistent With The Pressure-Dependent Results, Which Reveal That The C-2-H...F Interaction Is Enhanced Upon Increasing The Pressure. In Contrast To The Pf6- Salt, The Imidazolium C-H Bonds Of The Br- Salt Have Low Sensitivity To High Pressure. This Finding Suggests That The Hydrogen Bonding Patterns Are Determined By The Relative Hydrogen Bond Acceptor Strengths Of The Br- And Pf6- Ions. (C) 2004 American Institute Of Physics.},

It has been shown that the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anode surface is critical to the correct operation of secondary lithium-ion batteries, including those working with ionic liquids as electrolytes. The \{SEI\} layer may be formed by electrochemical transformation of (i) a molecular additive, (ii) \{RTIL\} cations or (iii) \{RTIL\} anions. Such properties of \{RTIL\} electrolytes as viscosity, conductivity, vapour pressure and lithium-ion transport numbers are also discussed from the point of view of their influence on battery performance. },

%  Abstract                 = {Optically heterodyne-detected optical Kerr effect experiments are applied to study the orientational dynamics of the supercooled ionic organic liquids N-propyl-3-methylpyridinium bis( trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (PMPIm) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tosylate (EMImTOS). The orientational dynamics are complex with relaxation involving several power law decays followed by a final exponential decay. A mode coupling theory (MCT) schematic model, the Sjogren model, was able to reproduce the PMPIm data very successfully over a wide range of times from 1 ps to hundreds of ns for all temperatures studied. Over the temperature range from room temperature down to the critical temperature T-c of 231 K, the OHD-OKE signal of PMPIm is characterized by the intermediate power law t(-1.00 +/- 0.04) at short times, a von Schweidler power law t(-0.51 +/- 0.03) at intermediate times, and a highly temperature-dependent exponential ( alpha relaxation) at long times. This form of the decay is identical to the form observed previously for a large number of organic van der Waals liquids. MCT analysis indicates that the theory can explain the experimental data very well for a range of temperatures above T-c, but as might be expected, there are some deviations from the theoretical modeling at temperatures close to T-c. For EMImTOS, the orientational dynamics were studied on the ps time scale in the deeply supercooled region near its glass transition temperature. The orientational relaxation of EMImTOS clearly displays the feature associated with the boson peak at similar to 2 ps, which is the first time domain evidence of the boson peak in ionic organic liquids. Overall, all the dynamical features observed earlier for organic van der Waals liquids using the same experimental technique are also observed for organic ionic liquids.},

Their surface activity and aggregation behavior in aqueous solution were systematically investigated through measurement of surface tension, conductivity, dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and cyro-transmission electron microscopy (Cyro-TEM). The surface tension of the aqueous trisiloxane RT-ILs solutions measured at the critical aggregate concentration (CAC) were observed to be about 20&#xa0;mN&#xa0;mâ??1, much lower than those of traditional N-alkyl ionic liquids. With a combination of \{DLS\} data and \{TEM\} measurements, formations of multilamellar vesicles in trisiloxane RT-ILs solutions appear to occur at a concentration above the CAC. },

In this work, a kind of phosphonium-based IL, [PC6C6C6C14][Tf2N], was studied under several conditions using molecular dynamics simulations based on both the all-atom force field (AAFF) and the united-atom force field. Liquid density was calculated to validate the force field. Compared with experimental data, good agreement was obtained for the simulated density based on the AAFF. Heat capacities at constant pressure were calculated at several temperatures, and good linear relationships were observed. Self-diffusion coefficients, viscosities and conductivities were also calculated to study the dynamics properties of this IL. The viscosity of this IL at 293 K was also compared with experimental data, and the error was in a reasonable range. In order to depict the microstructures of the IL, centre-of-mass and site-to-site radial distribution functions were employed. In addition, spatial distribution functions were investigated to present the more intuitive features.},

The model is based on the OPLS-AA/AMBER framework. Ab initio calculations were performed to obtain several terms in the force field not yet defined in the literature. These include torsion energy profiles and distributions of atomic charges that blend smoothly with the OPLS-AA specification for alkyl chains. Validation was carried out by comparing simulated and experimental data on fourteen different salts, comprising three types of anion and five lengths of alkyl chain, in both the crystalline and liquid phases. The present model can be regarded as a step toward a general force field for ionic liquids of the imidazolium cation family that was built in a systematic way, is easily integrated with OPLS-AA/AMBER, and is transferable between different combinations of cation-anion.},

%  Abstract                 = {Nanometer-scale structuring in room-temperature ionic liquids is observed using molecular simulation. The ionic liquids studied belong to the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium family with hexafluorophosphate or with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide as the anions, [C(n)mim][PF6] or [C(n)mim][(CF3SO2)(2)N], respectively. They were represented, for the first time in a simulation study focusing on long-range structures, by an all-atom force field of the AMBER/OPLS_AA family containing parameters developed specifically for these compounds. For ionic liquids with alkyl side chains longer than or equal to C-4, aggregation of the alkyl chains in nonpolar domains is observed. These domains permeate a tridimensional network of ionic channels formed by anions and by the imidazolium rings of the cations. The nanostructures can be visualized in a conspicuous way simply by color coding the two types of domains (in this work, we chose red = polar and green = nonpolar). As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the nonpolar domains become larger and more connected and cause swelling of the ionic network, in a manner analogous to systems exhibiting microphase separation. The consequences of these nanostructural features on the properties of the ionic liquids are analyzed.},

Studies of dissolved molecules show the importance of electrostatic interactions in both aromatic and hydrogen-bonding solutes. However, the local structure strongly depends upon ion???ion and solute???solvent interactions. We find interesting local alignments of cations at the gas???liquid and solid???liquid interfaces, which give a potential drop through the surface. If the solid interface is charged, this charge is strongly screened over distances of a few nanometres and this screening decays on a fast time scale. We have studied the sensitivity of the liquid structure to force-field parameters and show that results from ab initio simulations can be used in the development of force fields.},

In parallel with this, a variety of electrochemical devices including solar cells, high energy density batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors have become of intense interest as part of various proposed solutions to improve sustainability of energy supply in our societies. Much of our work over the last ten years has been motivated by such applications. Here we summarize the role of ionic liquids in these devices and the insights that the research provides for the broader field of interest of these fascinating liquids.},

%  Abstract                 = {Ionic liquids are liquids comprised totally of ions. However, not all of the ions present appear to be available to participate in conduction processes, to a degree that is dependent on the nature of the ionic liquid and its structure. There is much interest in quantifying and understanding this 'degree of ionicity' phenomenon. In this paper we present transport data for a range of ionic liquids and evaluate the data firstly in terms of the Walden plot as an approximate and readily accessible approach to estimating ionicity. An adjusted Walden plot that makes explicit allowance for differences in ion sizes is shown to be an improvement to this approach for the series of ionic liquids described. In some cases, where diffusion measurements are possible, it is feasible to directly quantify ionicity via the Nernst-Einstein equation, confirming the validity of the adjusted Walden plot approach. Some of the ionic liquids studied exhibit ionicity values very close to ideal; this is discussed in terms of a model of a highly associated liquid in which the ion correlations have similar impact on both the diffusive and conductive motions. Ionicity, as defined, is thus a useful measure of adherence to the Nernst-Einstein equation, but is not necessarily a measure of ion availability in the chemical sense.},

Expressions Are Derived To Relate The Spectra Of The Fluctuating Polarizability Induced By The Ion Coulomb Field And By The Dipole-Induced Dipole Mechanism To The Spectra Of The Mass And Charge Density Fluctuations (I.E., The Dynamical Structure Factors). The Theory Thereby Connects The Spectral Features Seen In Light Scattering To Well Known Dynamical Processes In The Ionic Melt, Such As The Charge Density Wave (Plasmon) And The Ionic Diffusive Motion. The Validity Of This Description Is Confirmed By Evaluating The Theoretical Expression, Using Dynamical Structure Factors Calculated In Computer Simulations, And Comparing It With Spectra Calculated Directly From The Simulations.},

The Dependence Of The Polarizability Of The Melt On The Ionic Positions, Which Determines The Raman Spectrum Through The Time Dependence Of The Polarizability Correlation Function, Is Modeled On The Basis Of Ab Initio Electronic Structure Calculations Carried Out On Alkali Chlorides. New Simulation Techniques Are Introduced In Order To Allow The Spectrum To Be Calculated With Acceptable Statistics. The Calculated Spectra Are In Semiquantitative Agreement With Experimental Data. The Distinctive Bands Which Appear In The Spectra Of Such Complex Melts Are Linked To The Vibrations Of The Transient Coordination Complexes Which Form In These Melts And New Interpretations For The Origin Of Several Well-Known Features Are Proposed.

%  Abstract                 = {Ionic liquids are salts that are liquid near ambient conditions. Interest in these unusual compounds has exploded in the last decade, both at the academic and commercial level. Molecular simulations based on classical potentials have played an important role in helping researchers understand how condensed phase properties of these materials are linked to chemical structure and composition. Simulations have also predicted many properties and unexpected phenomena that have subsequently been confirmed experimentally. The beneficial impact molecular simulations have had on this field is due in large part to excellent timing. Just when computing power and simulation methods matured to the point where complex fluids could be studied in great detail, a new class of materials virtually unknown to experimentalists came on the scene and demanded attention. This topical review explores some of the history of ionic liquid molecular simulations, and then gives examples of the recent use of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation in understanding the structure of ionic liquids, the sorption of small molecules in ionic liquids, the nature of ionic liquids in the vapor phase and the dynamics of ionic liquids. This review concludes with a discussion of some of the outstanding problems facing the ionic liquid modeling community and how condensed phase molecular simulation experts not presently working on ionic liquids might help advance the field.},

%  Abstract                 = {Atomistic simulations have emerged in recent years as an important compliment to experiment for understanding how the properties of ionic liquids are controlled by their underlying chemical structure. The ability to obtain reliable thermodynamic and transport properties from a simulation depends both on the quality of the force field and on the use of a proper simulation method. Properties such as densities and heat capacities may be obtained readily using standard techniques. With more effort and advanced simulation methods, solid???liquid and vapor???liquid phase equilibria may also be determined. Transport properties can also be computed, but the notoriously slow dynamics of many ionic liquid systems means that great care must be taken to ensure that the simulations are accurate.},

New data for the solubility of CO2 in the ionic liquid/organic mixtures and the volume expansion of the mixtures with added CO2 are used to analyze the results. Acetonitrile, 2-butanone, and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol are chosen to distinguish dipolar and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Likewise, 1-n-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, 1-n-hexyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, 1-n-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium triflate, and ethyl-dimethyl-propylammonium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide were studied to vary hydrogen-bond-donating and -accepting abilities of the ionic liquids. Primarily, the ability of CO2 to act as an antisolvent depends on the solubility of the CO2 in the ionic liquid/organic mixture. Strong hydrogen bonding between the ionic liquid and the organic makes it more difficult for CO2 to induce a liquid/liquid-phase separation.},

%  Abstract                 = {Pharmaceutical industries have posed challenges in the topical and transdermal administration of drugs which are poorly soluble or insoluble in water and most of organic solvents. In an approach to overcome this limitation, ionic liquid-in-oil (IL/o) microemulsions (MEs) were employed to increase the solubility of a sparingly soluble drug to enhance its topical and transdermal delivery. The formulation of \{MEs\} was composed of a blend of nonionic surfactants, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween-80) and sorbitan laurate (Span-20), isopropyl myristate (IPM) as an oil phase, and \{IL\} [C1mim] [(CH3O)2PO2] (dimethylimidazolium dimethylphosphate) as a pseudophase. Among various weight ratios of Tween-80 to Span-20 investigated in the \{ME\} systems, the ratio 3:2 showed excellent solubility and skin permeation enhancing effect for acyclovir (ACV) used as a model sparingly soluble drug. The size and size distribution of the \{ME\} droplets with and without drug were determined by dynamic light scattering. The permeability study of \{ACV\} incorporated in \{IL\} droplets as well as other formulations was performed into and across the Yucatan micropig (YMP) porcine skin, and the use of IL/o \{MEs\} has been shown to dramatically increase \{ACV\} administration. Finally, the cytotoxicity of the new carrier was evaluated in vitro using the reconstructed human epidermal model LabCyteâ?¢ EPI-MODEL12. It was found that the cell viability of IL/o \{MEs\} containing 4&#xa0;wt% \{IL\} was over 80% compared to Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Salines, indicating low cytotoxicity of the carrier. Taken together these results, it can be assumed that IL-assisted nonaqueous \{ME\} could serve as a versatile and efficient nanodelivery system for insoluble or sparingly soluble drug molecules that require solubilizing agents for delivery. },

%  Abstract                 = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have become an important class of solvents and soft materials over the past decades. Despite being salts built by discrete cations and anions, many of them are liquid at room temperature and below. They have been used in a wide variety of applications such as electrochemistry, separation science, chemical synthesis and catalysis, for breaking azeotropes, as thermal fluids, lubricants and additives, for gas storage, for cellulose processing, and photovoltaics. It has been realized that the true advantage of ILs is their modular character. Each specific cation-anion combination is characterized by a unique, characteristic set of chemical and physical properties. Although ILs have been known for roughly a century, they are still a novel class of compounds to exploit due to the vast number of possible ion combinations and one fundamental question remains still inadequately answered: why do certain salts like ILs have such a low melting point and do not crystallize readily? This Review aims to give an insight into the liquid-solid phase transition of ILs from the viewpoint of a solid-state chemist and hopes to contribute to a better understanding of this intriguing class of compounds. It will introduce the fundamental theories of liquid-solid-phase transition and crystallization from melt and solution. Aside form the formation of ideal crystals the development of solid phases with disorder and of lower order like plastic crystals and liquid crystals by ionic liquid compounds are addressed. The formation of ionic liquid glasses is discussed and finally practical techniques, strategies and methods for crystallization of ionic liquids are given.},

%  Abstract                 = {In a previous paper, we reported the first dry actuator that can be fabricated simply by layer-by-layer casting, using [`]bucky gel', a gelatinous room-temperature ionic-liquid containing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Our actuator has a bimorph configuration with a polymer-supported internal ionic-liquid electrolyte layer sandwiched by two polymer-supported bucky-gel electrode layers, which allows quick and long-lived operation in air at low applied voltages. In this paper, we propose a new two-step process using a ball-mill method for preparing the casting solution for the bucky-gel electrode in order to improve the performance of the actuator by developing the bucky-gel electrode layer with a high content of SWNTs which are well dispersed in the electrode layer. We measured the displacement and the blocking force of the new bucky-gel actuator fabricated by hot-pressing the prepared electrode and electrolyte layers and analyzed its experimental results by the tri-layer polymer actuator model which was developed by Alici et al. for conducting polymer actuators. We developed the low-voltage driven solid-state actuator that shows the maximum stress and the strain of 4.7?MPa and 1.9%, respectively, which are comparable with any other low-voltage driven solid-state electroactive polymer actuator technology to our knowledge. The advantage of our bucky-gel actuator is not only in its good performance but also in its easy process in fabrication. The present development provides an important step for electromechanical polymer actuator technologies.},

Molecular Dynamics Simulations Of Both Systems Were Performed At Various Mole Fractions Of Water. A Linear Relationship Between The Mean Residence Time And The System's Viscosity Is Found From The Direct Analysis Independent Of The System's Type. The Complex Time Behavior Of Shell Relaxation Can Be Modeled By A Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts Function With An Almost Universal Stretching Parameter Of 1/2 Indicative Of A Square Root Time Law. The Probabilistic Model Enables An Intuitive Interpretation Of Essential Motional Parameters Otherwise Not Accessible By Direct Analysis. Even More, Incorporating The Square Root Time Law Into The Probabilistic Model Enables A Quantitative Prediction Of Shell Relaxation From Very Short Simulation Studies.

%  Abstract                 = {The addition of lithium salts to ionic liquids causes an increase in viscosity and a decrease in ionic mobility that hinders their possible application as an alternative solvent in lithium ion batteries. Optically heterodyne-detected optical Kerr effect spectroscopy was used to study the change in dynamics, principally orientational relaxation, caused by the addition of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide to the ionic liquid 1-buty1-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. Over the time scales studied (1 ps-16 ns) for the pure ionic liquid, two temperature-independent power laws were observed: the intermediate power law (1 ps to similar to 1 ns), followed by the von Schweidler power law. The von Schweidler power law is followed by the final complete exponential relaxation, which is highly sensitive to temperature. The lithium salt concentration, however, was found to affect both power laws, and a discontinuity could be found in the trend observed for the intermediate power law when the concentration (mole fraction) of lithium salt is close to chi(LiTf(2)N) = 0.2. A mode coupling theory (MCT) schematic model was also used to fit the data for both the pure ionic liquid and the different salt concentration mixtures. It was found that dynamics in both types of liquids are described very well by MCT.},

%  Abstract                 = {In this paper we use ab initio theoretical methods in combination with experimental studies to investigate ion-pairs of the ionic liquid (IL) 1-methyl-3-pentamethyldisiloxymethylimidazolium chloride [(SiOSi)C1C1im]Cl{,} in order to deepen our understanding of the effects of functionalisation on an IL. In addition{,} we focus on the effect of the siloxy group on the viscosity. We establish that the ion-pairing energies of [(SiOSi)C1C1im]Cl are similar to those of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [C4C1im]Cl{,} because the anion interacts primarily with the imidazolium ring. A large range of ion-pair structural configurations is possible with different anion positions and chain orientations{,} contributing to a significant entropy. A H-bonded network forms{,} however the siloxy chain can shield the Cl- or key C-H sites thus introducing defects. Despite a significant increase in mass relative to [C4C1im]+{,} the combined barriers to rotation within the substituent chain are substantially reduced in [(SiOSi)C1C1im]+{,} this is primarily due to the flexibility of the siloxane linkage{,} and free rotation of the Si-Me methyl groups. The most important effect is a coupling of rotational motions within the chain which leads to dynamic inter-conversion of cation conformers{,} and facilitates movement of the anion around the cation{,} these will contribute to enhanced transport properties and a reduced viscosity. In addition{,} a longer charge arm is expected to enhance rotational and rotational-translational coupling in electric fields. Thus{,} for [(SiOSi)C1C1im]Cl ion-pair association is very similar to that of [C4C1im]Cl{,} but {"}dynamic{"} properties relating to torsional motion{,} a dynamic H-bonded network{,} and cation response to an external electric field are enhanced.},

The reflectivity versus momentum transfer (Q) plot shows a broad peak at Q ~ 0.4??-1, implying the presence of ionic layers at the [TOMA+][C4C4N-] surface. The analysis using model fittings revealed that at least four layers are formed with the interlayer distance of 16 ?. TOMA+ and C4C4N- are suggested not to be segregated as alternating cationic and anionic layers at the [TOMA+][C4C4N-] surface. It is likely that the detection of the ionic multilayers with x-ray reflectivity has been realized by virtue of the greater size of TOMA+ and C4C4N- and the high critical temperature of [TOMA+][C4C4N-].},

We investigated the melting and freezing behaviors of [bmim]Br and [bmim]Cl by using a homemade differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) with nano-Watt stability and sensitivity. The measurements were carried out at heating and cooling rates slow enough to mimic quasi-static processes. Their thermal behaviors of melting and freezing show characteristic features such as a wide pre-melting range and excessive supercooling and individual behaviors of single crystals even for the same substance. The melting temperatures of [bmim]Br and [bmim]Cl were determined from the broad DSC traces and discussed in relation to the crystal structure. We suggest that the observed characteristics are due to the dynamics of the cooperative change between gauche???trans (GT) and trans???trans (TT) conformations of the butyl group in the [bmim]+ cation.},

The thermal property, d., self-diffusion coeff. of the anions and cations, viscosity, and ionic cond. were measured for these ionic liqs. in wide temp. ranges. A pulsed-gradient spin-echo NMR method was used to independently measure self-diffusion coeffs. of the anions (19F NMR) and the cations (1H NMR). The results indicate that the cations diffuse almost equally to the anion in EMIBF4 and BPBF4, whereas they diffuse faster than the anion in EMITFSI and BPTFSI. The summation of the cationic and anionic diffusion coeffs. for each ionic liq. follows the order EMITFSI > EMIBF4 > BPTFSI > BPBF4, under an isothermal condition. The order of the magnitude of the diffusion coeff. well contrasts with that of the viscosity for each ionic liq. The temp. dependencies of the self-diffusion coeff., viscosity, and ionic cond. obey the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) equation, and the VTF parameters were presented. Relationships among the self-diffusion coeff., viscosity, and molar cond. were analyzed in terms of the Stokes-Einstein equation and the Nernst-Einstein equation. The most interesting feature of the relationships is that the ratios of the molar cond., detd. by complex impedance measurements, to that calcd. from the NMR diffusion coeffs., range from 0.6 to 0.8 for EMIBF4 and BPBF4, whereas the ratios range from 0.3 to 0.5 for EMITFSI and BPTFSI. This difference could be understood by taking the ionic assocn. into consideration for EMITFSI and BPTFSI.},

Phys. 123, 134105 (2005)] employs a variational principle to determine an interaction potential for a CG model from simulations of an atomically detailed model of the same system. The companion paper proved that, if no restrictions regarding the form of the CG interaction potential are introduced and if the equilibrium distribution of the atomistic model has been adequately sampled, then the MS-CG variational principle determines the exact many-body potential of mean force (PMF) governing the equilibrium distribution of CG sites generated by the atomistic model. In practice, though, CG force fields are not completely flexible, but only include particular types of interactions between CG sites, e.g., nonbonded forces between pairs of sites. If the CG force field depends linearly on the force field parameters, then the vector valued functions that relate the CG forces to these parameters determine a set of basis vectors that span a vector subspace of CG force fields. The companion paper introduced a distance metric for the vector space of CG force fields and proved that the MS-CG variational principle determines the CG force force field that is within that vector subspace and that is closest to the force field determined by the many-body PMF. The present paper applies the MS-CG variational principle for parametrizing molecular CG force fields and derives a linear least squares problem for the parameter set determining the optimal approximation to this many-body PMF. Linear systems of equations for these CG force field parameters are derived and analyzed in terms of equilibrium structural correlation functions. Numerical calculations for a one-site CG model of methanol and a molecular CG model of the EMIM+/NO3- ionic liquid are provided to illustrate the method.},

(RTIL) 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bistriflimide occurs via 2 consecutive 1-electron processes leading to the radical anion and dianion, resp. The radical anion exhibited electrochem. reversibility at all time-scales whereas the dianion exhibited reversibility at potential sweep rates of >=10 V s-1, collectively indicating the absence of strong ion-paring with the RTIL cation. But redn. in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bistriflimide is complicated by proton-transfer from the [Bmim] cation. At low potential sweep rates, redn. involves a single 2-electron process characteristic of either an electrochem., chem., electrochem. (ECE) or disproportion-type (DISP1) mechanism. The rate of radical anion protonation in [Bmim] is governed by basicity and conforms to the Hammett free-energy relation. At higher potential sweep rates in [Bmim][NTf2], redn. occurs via 2 consecutive 1-electron processes, giving rise to the partially reversible generation of the radical anion and the irreversible generation of the dianion, resp. Also, the redox potentials for the reversible parent/radical anion couples are a linear function of Hammett substituent consts. in both RTIL media and exhibited effectively equiv. solvent-dependent reaction consts., which are similar to those for redn. in polar mol. solvents such as MeCN or alcs.},

%  Abstract                 = {The preparation of ionic liquids derived from amino acids, and their properties, are outlined. Since amino acids have both a carboxylic acid residue and an amino group in a single molecule, they can be used as either anions or cations. These groups are also useful in their ability to introduce functional group(s). Twenty different natural amino acids were used as anions, to couple with the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation. The salts obtained were all liquid at room temperature. The properties of the resulting ionic liquids (AAILs) depend on the side groups of the amino acids involved. These AAILs, composed of an amino acid with some functional groups such as a hydrogen bonding group, a charged group, or an aromatic ring, had an increased glass transition (or melting) temperature and/or higher viscosity as a result of additional interactions among the ions. Viscosity is reduced and the decomposition temperature of imidazolium-type salts is improved by using the tetrabutylphosphonium cation. The chirality of AAILs was maintained even upon heating to 150 ??C after acetylation of the free amino group. The amino group was also modified to introduce a strong acid group so as to form hydrophobic and chiral ionic liquids. Unique phase behavior of the resulting hydrophobic ionic liquids and water mixture is found; the mixture is clearly phase separated at room temperature, but the solubility of water in this IL increases upon cooling, to give a homogeneous solution. This phase change is reversible, and separation occurs again by raising the temperature a few degrees. It is extraordinary for an IL/water mixture to display such behavior with a lower critical solution temperature. Some likely applications are proposed for these amino acid derived ionic liquids.},

%  Abstract                 = {Understanding physicochemical properties of ionic liquids is important for their rational use in extractions, reactions, and other applications. Ionic liquids are not simple fluids: their ions are generally asymetric, flexible, with delocalized electrostatic charges, and available in a wide variety. It is difficult to capture their subtle properties with models that are too simplistic. Molecular simulation using atomistic force fields, which describe structures and interactions in detail, is an excellent tool to gain insights into their liquid-state organization, how they solvate different compounds, and what molecular factors determine their properties. The identification of certain ionic liquids as self-organized phases, with aggregated nonpolar and charged domains, provides a new way to interpret the solvation and structure of their mixtures. Many advances are the result of a successful interplay between experiment and modeling, possible in this field where none of the two methodologies had a previous advance.},

%  Abstract                 = {As an effective extraction method, aqueous two-phase extraction systems based on imidazolium ionic liquids have been used, in this work, to extract proteins of bovine serum albumin, trypsin, cytochrome c and Î³-globulins. Effects of the ionic liquids concentration, pH value, and temperature of the systems on the extraction efficiencies have been investigated. Experimental results show that 75â¤?100% of the proteins could be extracted into the ionic liquid-rich phase in a single-step extraction. The extraction efficiency of cytochrome c was changed slightly with the increase of pH values. Extraction efficiencies of the proteins were found to increase with increasing temperature and increasing alkyl chain length of cation of the ionic liquids. Thermodynamic studies indicated that hydrophobic interactions were the main driving force, although electrostatic interactions and salting-out effects were also important for the transfer of the proteins. Importantly, conformation of the proteins was not affected after extraction into the upper ionic liquid-rich phase as determined by UVâ¤?visible (UVâ¤?vis) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy of the proteins. The enzyme activity of native trypsin and the trypsin in ionic liquids was determined using N-Î±-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester as a substrate. This novel process is suggested to have important applications for the separation of proteins. },

The fluid is confined between two parallel and oppositely charged walls, emulating two electrified solid???liquid interfaces. Attention is focused on structural, electrostatic, and dynamical properties, which are compared with those of the nonpolarized fluid. It is found that the relaxation of the electrostatic potential, after switching the electric field off, occurs in two stages. A first, subpicosecond process accounts for 80% of the decay and is followed by a second subdiffusive process with a time constant of 8 ps. Diffusion is not involved in the relaxation, which is mostly driven by small anion translations. The relaxation of the polarization in the confined system is discussed in terms of the spectrum of charge density fluctuations in the bulk.},

These ionic liquids were found to exhibit marked nanoscale ordering in their isotropic liquid state as judged from the small angle X-ray scattering. The observed structural ordering is of supramolecular order and depends strongly on the length of the cation hydrophobic side chain. Moreover{,} the data can be analyzed on the basis of a disordered smectic A phase{,} consisting of strongly interdigitated bilayers that sequester the ionic liquid into polar and hydrophobic regions. These findings were also found to be consistent with density data of these molten salts. Additionally{,} we demonstrate that this experimentally observed nanostructuring can further be fine-tuned using binary mixtures.},

Instrument-specific effects on the real-space PDF were investigated, such as finite measurement range, the instrument resolution and the asymmetric shape of diffraction peaks. Two illustrative samples, a perfectly long-range-ordered element, Pb, and a locally strained alloy ZnSe0.5Te0.5, were measured at low temperatures. Various aspects of the PDF were explored, either qualitatively by direct comparison or quantitatively via structural modelling. Future implementation of modelling codes incorporating some of these instrumental effects are also discussed.},

%  Abstract                 = {Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) have been proposed as alternative solvents for organic synthesis, separations, and electrochemical applications. Here, we report studies that probe the electrochemical and solvation properties of a tetraalkylammonium (methyltributylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfon)imide, M3BNIm) and an imidazolium (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, BMIPF6) based ionic liquid. It is demonstrated that despite impurities, the cathodic limit at a Pt electrode is enhanced for the tetraalkylammonium-based IL. Electrogenerated chemiluminescence of tris(2,2'-bipyrindinyl)ruthenium (Ru(bpy)3(2+)) was observed in both ionic liquids, and differences in the response were interpreted in terms of the solvent reactivity and polarity. As ILs have been proposed as alternatives to organic solvents in extraction processes, an understanding of the relative lipophilicity of the IL ions and the equilibrium potential difference established across the IL/water interface is of fundamental relevance. Here, electrochemical measurements at a conventionally polarized liquid-liquid interface (water/1,2-dichloroethane) were used to determine the relative lipophilicity of the IL constituent ions. From formal ion transfer potential values (Delta(o)(w)phi(1)(0)) obtained, the standard ionic partition coefficients could be estimated. The polarizability of the neat ionic liquid/water interface was investigated, From these studies, it can be seen that BMIPF6 is hydrophilic while M3BNIm is moderately hydrophobic. The significance of the potential difference established across the IL/water interface is discussed.},

With This, We Provide Both Prediction For The Densities Of The Mixtures That Have Mostly Not Been Investigated Experimentally Yet And A Molecular Picture Of The Interactions Between The Alcohol Molecules And The Ions. The Negative Excess Energies Of All Mixtures Indicate An Energetically Favorable Mixing Of {[}Amim]{[}Cl] Ils And Alcohols. To Gain Insight Into The Nonideality Of The Mixtures On The Molecular Level, We Analyzed Their Local Structures By Radial And Spatial Distribution Functions. These Analyses Show That The Local Ordering In These Mixtures Is Determined By Strong Hydrogen-Bond Interactions Between The Chloride Anion And The Hydroxyls Of The Alcohols, Enhanced Interactions Between The Anion And The Charged Domain Of The Cation, And An Increasing Aggregation Of The Nonpolar Alkyl Tails Of The Alcohols And The Cations With Increasing Cation Size, Which Results In A Segregation Of Polar And Nonpolar Domains.

The Method Has Been Applied To Examine The Interfacial Structure In Two Ionic Liquids, Consisting Of Binary Mixtures Of Molten Salts, Chosen To Exemplify The Influences Of Dissimilar Cation Size And Charge. The Stronger Coordination Of The Smaller And More Highly Charged Cations By The Anions Prevents Them From Approaching Even The Negatively Charged Electrode Closely.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations Of Molten (Li,Cs)No3, (Li,K)No3, (Li,Na)No3, (Na,Cs)No3, Each At Two Different Compositions At A Given Temperature, And Also Pure Lino3 And Pure Kno3, Have Been Performed With The Aim Of Reproducing The Chemla Effect. The Key Role Played By Anion Polarization On The Chemla Effect In Molten Alkali Nitrates Is Demonstrated By Comparing The Calculated Mobilities Using Nonpolarizable And Polarizable Models. Polarization Effects Were Included In The Simulations By Using A Previously Proposed Fluctuating Charge Model (Fcm) For The No3- Anion. It Is Shown That A Single Potential Model For A (M-1,M-2)No3 Mixture Gives The Correct Composition Dependence Of The M-1 And The M-2 Mobilities Provided That Polarization Effects Are Included In The Model. The Fcm Is Thus Transferable Between Different Systems, But Not Its Nonpolarizable Counterpart.

On The Basis Of The Electronegativity Equalization Method, Polarization Effects In The Md Simulations Have Been Introduced By A Fluctuating Charge (Fc) Model For The Nitrate Ion. Partial Charges In The Nitrate Ion Are Obtained By Ab Initio Calculations At Several Levels Of Theory, And Compared With Previously Proposed Models For Md Simulations Of Nitrate Melts. Charge Fluctuation Is Achieved In The Ab Initio Calculations By Using Positive Probe Charges Placed Around A Nitrate Ion. The Parameters Of The Fc Model Are Corroborated By Comparison Of The Ab Initio Partial Charges With The Ones Obtained Directly By The Electronegativity Equalization Method. Simulated Annealing Of A Cluster Including Two Double-Charged Cations And Two Nitrate Ions Shows That Very Different Structures Are Obtained Depending On Whether The Fc Model Or Its Nonpolarizable Counterpart Is Considered.

Raman spectra of [bmim]PF6 agree with previous results obtained by optical Kerr effect spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. Both the superposition model and the coupling model give reasonable fit to low-frequency Raman spectra of [bmim]PF6. The configurational entropy of [bmim]PF6 has been evaluated as a function of temperature using recently reported data of heat capacity. The calculated configurational entropy is inserted in the Adam???Gibbs theory for supercooled liquids, giving a good fit to non-Arrhenius behavior of viscosity and diffusive process, with the latter revealed by a recent neutron scattering investigation of [bmim]PF6. There is a remarkable linear dependence between intensity of quasielastic Raman scattering and configurational entropy from 77 K up to the melting point of [bmim]PF6. This correlation offers insight into the nature of dynamical processes probed by low-frequency Raman spectra of ionic liquids.},

%  Abstract                 = { Classical force-field parameters have been developed for amines primarily by fitting to experimental data for pure liquids and to hydrogen-bond strengths from gas-phase ab initio calculations. The resultant parameters were used to calculate relative free energies of hydration for ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine using free energy perturbation calculations in Monte Carlo simulations (MC/FEP). The results including the fact that the most favorable à¥¾?Ghyd occurs for methylamine are in excellent agreement with the experimental data, in contrast to numerous prior computational reports. The calculations reveal two opposing trends in water:à¥?¤? increased contribution from hydrogen-bond acceptance and diminished contribution from hydrogen-bond donation with increasing methylation of the amines. The proper balance of hydrogen-bond strengths, which is achieved with the OPLS-AA force field, is essential for correct ordering of the free energies of hydration. MC simulations for the pure liquids of thirteen additional amines, not included in the original parametrization, then demonstrated the transferability of the force field. These simulations covered aliphatic as well as cyclic and aromatic amines. Furthermore, the appropriateness of the force field for less polar environments was confirmed through MC/FEP calculations of relative free energies of solvation and log P values in chloroform. It is apparent that the prior problems with classical force fields for amines were simply a result of nonoptimal parametrization rather than to a critical omission such as the lack of explicit polarization. },

The Latter Is Usually Measured To Higher Temperatures Than The Corresponding Relaxation Times, Demonstrating The Validity Of The Thermodynamic Scaling Throughout The Supercooled And Higher T Regimes. The Value Of Gamma For A Given Liquid Principally Reflects The Magnitude Of The Intermolecular Forces (E.G., Steepness Of The Repulsive Potential); Thus, We Find Decreasing Gamma In Going From Van Der Waals Fluids To Ionic Liquids.

%  Abstract                 = {In this study, we have examined both the effect of alkyl chain length and anion composition on the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium (Cnmim, n = 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) structure and orientation at the room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL)/SiO2 interface by sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (SFVS). Four different anions were investigated in this study:??? tetrafluoroborate (BF4), hexafluorophosphate (PF6), bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMSI), and bis(pentafluoroethylsulfonyl)imide (BETI). It was found that the alkyl chain in BMSI and BETI RTILs showed a decrease in gauche defects with an increase in chain length, whereas the alkyl chains of the BF4 and PF6 RTILs have virtually no gauche defects regardless of chain length. The tilt of the alkyl chain lies predominantly perpendicular to the surface for all the RTILs examined. A strong correlation between the HCCH vs tilt angle and alkyl chain length was observed; as the alkyl chain is lengthened the HCCH vs lies more perpendicular to the SiO2 surface. The results of this study suggest that the length of the alkyl chain dictates to a large degree the orientation of the imidazolium cation at the surface, regardless of anion composition. To a lesser extent, the HCCH vs tilt of the imidazolium ring of the cation also appears to be correlated to the surface charge density of the SiO2. As the SiO2 surface charge density becomes more negative the HCCH vs tilt angle lies more parallel to the surface.},

%  Abstract                 = {A Free Energy Model For The Inhomogeneous Hard-Sphere Fluid Mixture Was Derived Recently {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 63, 980 (1989)], Which Is Based On The Fundamental Geometric Measures Of The Particles. Along With An Updated Assessment Of Its Accuracy, This Model Is First Generalized For Charged Hard-Sphere Fluid Mixtures, In Which Every Particle Carries A Central Yukawa Charge, And It Is Then Extended To General Fluid Mixtures In External Fields. The Yukawa-Charged Hard-Sphere Mixture Provides A Quite General Reference System For Many Interesting Physical Systems Including Plasmas, Molten Salts, And Colloidal Dispersions, The Screening Parameter Enabling To Interpolate Between The Long Range Coulomb Forces And The Short Range Hard Cores. A Special Renormalization Property Of The Yukawa Potential Provides The Means To Derive The Exact Onsager-Type Lower Bound For The Potential Energy Of The Mixture, And Its Related Asymptotic Strong-Coupling Limit Of The Liquid Pair Correlation Functions. These Results Are Obtained Analytically For The General Homogeneous Mixture With Yukawa Interactions. They Enable To Extend The Fundamental Measure Free Energy Model To Inhomogeneous Charged Yukawa Mixtures, With The Charge Contributions Given By A Truncated Second Order Expansion From The Uniform (Bulk) Fluid Limit. The Resulting Free Energy Model, Which Interpolates Between The Ideal-Gas And `'Ideal-Liquid'' Limits, Then Leads To A Self-Consistent Method For Calculating The Density Profiles For General Fluid Mixtures In External Fields. This Method Is Equivalent To An Ansatz Of `'Universality Of The Bridge Functional.'' The `'Bridge Functional'' Consists Of All The Terms Beyond The Second Order, In The Expansion Of The Excess Free Energy Functional Around A Reference Uniform Fluid. The Self-Consistency Is Imposed By Applying The General Method In The Special Case When The External Potential Is Generated By A `'Test Particle'' At The Origin Of Coordinates. In This Limit, Our General Method For Nonuniform Fluids Corresponds To An Established And Successful Theory For The Bulk Uniform Fluid Pair Structure, Namely The Thermodynamically Consistent Modified-Hypernetted-Chain Theory, With The Bridge Functions Now Generated By An Explicit And Demonstratively Accurate, `'Universal,'' Hard-Sphere Bridge Functional. As A Stringent Test For The General Model, The Strongly Coupled One-Component Plasma, In The Bulk And Near A Hard Wall, Is Considered In Some Detail.},

The alkali halides are prototypes for this specific type of short-range order in relation to the nature of bonding, but the systems in question also include other monovalent and polyvalent metal-ion halides, alkali-based intermetallic compounds and chalcogen-based alloys. A viewpoint is taken in this review which gives attention to the relations between liquid and solid phase properties across melting for compound systems at stoichiometric composition. In addition, large deviations from stoichiometry can be realised in the liquid phase, to display trends of evolution of structure, bonding and electronic states with composition.},

%  Abstract                 = {Room temperature ionic liquids are one of the most exciting classes of materials in the last decade. The interest for these low melting{,} ionic compounds stems from both their technological impact and the stimulating plethora of structural and dynamic peculiarities in the mesoscopic space-time scales. It is nowadays well-established that they are characterised by an enhanced degree of mesoscopic order originating from their inherent amphiphilicity. In this contribution we highlight the existence of a further degree of mesoscopic complexity when dealing with RTILs bearing a medium length fluorous tail: such triphilic materials (they simultaneously contain polar{,} hydrophobic and fluorophilic moieties that mutually segregate from each other) turn out to be highly structurally compartmentalised at the mesoscopic level{,} thus paving the way to new smart applications for this new class of RTILs.},

Recently the possibility that such a feature{,} that is witnessed by the occurrence of peculiar low Q diffraction features{,} reflects nm-scale structural organization has been questioned on the basis of both experimental and computational studies. In this contribution we discuss these studies and present novel experimental evidence that confirm the existence of nm-scale spatial heterogeneities due to the segregation of apolar moieties dispersed in a polar network. The consequence of this scenario is that when the chain polarity gets closer to that of the charged head{,} the structural heterogeneities are no longer observed.},

%  Abstract                 = {The relationships between the ionic mobility, the viscosity, and the atomic-scale structure are investigated in computer simulations of mixtures of LiF and the network glass-forming material BeF2. The simulations span a wide range of compositions, across which the fluidity of the system changes greatly due to the break-up of the Be???F network by the addition of the LiF. The relationship between the conductivity and viscosity passes from that expected for independently diffusing ions in the dilute mixtures to strongly decoupled Li+ migration through a viscous network at higher concentrations. The transition between these r??gimes is linked to the changing local and intermediate-scale structure in the melts. The decoupling phenomenon is associated with the appearance of migration channels in the network which leads to cooperative effects in the Li+ migration.},

The Dielectric Spectra Are Interpreted As Superposition Of High-Frequency Relaxation Processes Associated With Dipolar Librations And A Conductivity Contribution. The Latter Originates From Hopping Of Charge Carriers On A Random Spatially Varying Potential Landscape And Quantitatively Fits The Observed Frequency And Temperature Dependence Of The Spectra. A Further Analysis Delivers The Hopping Rate And Enables One To Deduce-Using The Einstein-Smoluchowski Equation-The Translational Diffusion Coefficient Of The Charge Carriers In Quantitative Agreement With PFG-NMR Measurements. By That, The Mobility Is Determined And Separated From The Charge Carrier Density; For The Former, A Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann And For The Latter, An Arrhenius Temperature Dependence Is Obtained.

The limiting oxidation and reduction potentials, specific conductivity, and some other physicochemical properties of the novel ionic liquids, N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium tetrafluoroborate (DEME-BF4) and DEME-TFSI have been evaluated and compared with those of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate. DEME-BF4 is a practically useful ionic liquid for electrochemical capacitors as it has a quite wide potential window (6.0?V) and high ionic conductivity (4.8?mS?cm-1 at 25??C). We prepared an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) composed of a pair of activated carbon electrodes and DEME-BF4 as the electrolyte. This EDLC (working voltage ~2.5?V) has both, a higher capacity above room temperature and a better charge-discharge cycle durability at 100??C when compared to a conventional EDLC using an organic liquid electrolyte such as a tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in propylene carbonate.},

Ionic Liquids Are Characterized By Both A Molecular Dipole Moment And A Net Charge. Thus, In Contrast To A Solution Of Simple Ions In A (Non-) Polar Solvent, Rotational And Translational Effects Influence The Very Same Molecule. This Study Works Out The Theoretical Framework Necessary To Compute The Conductivity Spectrum And Its Low Frequency Limit Of Ionic Liquids. Merging These Computed Conductivity Spectra With Previous Simulation Results On The Dielectric Spectra Of Ionic Liquids Yields The Spectrum Of The Generalized Dielectric Constant, Which May Be Compared To Experiments. This Spectrum Was Calculated For The Three Ionic Liquids Over Six Orders Of Magnitude In Frequency Ranging From 10 Mhz To 50 Thz. The Role Of Rotation And Translation And Their Coupling Term On The Generalized Dielectric Constant Is Discussed In Detail With A Special Emphasis On The Zero-Frequency Limit.

The Focus Lies On The Comparison Of Experimental And Computational Data. On The One Hand, A Computational Analysis Permits A Complete Decomposition Of Spectra, Both With Respect To Dynamical Behavior (Translation And Rotation) As Well As To Composition Of The Mixture (Cation, Anion, And Water). Thereby, Not Only The Peak Assignment In Experimental Spectra Is Enabled But One Can Also Learn More About Solvation Properties. Of Particular Importance Is The Interplay Of The Dielectric Constant And The Conductivity Representing A Measure Of Collective Rotational And Translational Motion. On The Other Hand, The Comparison With Experimental Spectra Is Essential For The Validation Of The Force Fields Used In Simulation. The Satisfying Agreement Between Corresponding Peaks In The Dielectric Spectra Confirms Not Only Computed Dielectric Relaxation Times But Also Other Collective Dynamical Properties Such As The Viscosity. Nevertheless, The Detailed Fine Structure Of The Conductivity Regime Reveals Specific Ion-Pair Effects Not Covered By The Simulation. A Possible Confinement Of Dynamical Heterogeneity As A Consequence Of A System Size Effect Is Also Indicated.},

This Is The Third Part Of A Series Concerning The Collective Network Of 1-Butyl-3-Methyl-Imidazolium Tetrafluoroborate/Water Mixtures. The First Part {[}C. Schroumlder , J. Chem.

In This Work The Focus Lies On The Characterization Of The Neighborhood Of Ionic Liquids By Means Of The Voronoi Decomposition. The Voronoi Algorithm Is A Rational Tool To Uniquely Decompose The Space Around A Reference Molecule Without Using Any Empirical Parameters. Thus, Neighborhood Relations, Direct And Indirect Ones, Can Be Extracted And Were Used In Combination With G-Coefficients. These Coefficients Represent The Generalization Of The Traditional Radial Distribution Function In Order To Include The Mutual Positioning And Orientation Of Anisotropic Molecules. Furthermore, The Voronoi Method Provides, As A By-Product, The Mutual Coordination Numbers Of Molecular Species.},

The Local Structure Of Each Of These Six Networks Is Investigated By Atom-Atom Radial Distribution Functions As Well As By The So-Called G Coefficients, Which Reveal The Mutual Orientation Of The Network Constituting Partners.

Besides The Common Structural Analysis, E.G., Radial Distribution Functions And Three Dimensional Occupancy Plots, A More Sophisticated Orientational Analysis Was Performed. The Angular Correlation Functions G(00)(110)(R) And G(00)(101)(R) Are The First Distance Dependent Coefficients Of The Pairwise Orientational Distribution Function G(R(Ij),Omega(1),Omega(2),Omega(12)). These Functions Help To Interpret The Three Dimensional Plot And Reveal Interesting Insights Into The Local Structure Of The Analyzed Ionic Liquids. Furthermore, The Collective Network Of Ionic Liquids Can Be Characterized By The Kirkwood Factor G(Kappa)(R) {[}J. Chem. Phys. 7, 911 (1939)]. The Short-Range Behavior (R < 10 A) Of This Factor May Be Suitable To Predict The Water Miscibility Of The Ionic Liquid. The Long-Range Limit Of G(K)(Infinity) Is Below 1 Which Demonstrates The Strongly Coupled Nature Of The Ionic Liquid Networks. In Addition, This Factor Relates The Orientational Structure And The Dielectric Properties Of The Ionic Liquids. The Static Dielectric Constant Epsilon(Omega=0) For The Simulated System Is 8.9-9.5.

%  Abstract                 = {The Vast Majority Of Molecular Dynamics Simulations Are Based On Nonpolarizable Force Fields With Fixed Partial Charges For All Atoms. The Traditional Way To Obtain These Charges Are Quantum-Mechanical Calculations Performed Prior To Simulation. Unfortunately, The Set Of The Partial Charges Heavily Relies On The Method And The Basis Set Used. Therefore, Investigations Of The Influence Of Charge Variation On Simulation Data Are Necessary In Order To Validate Various Charge Sets. This Paper Elucidates The Consequences Of Different Charge Sets On The Structure And Dynamics Of The Ionic Liquid: 1-Ethyl-3-Methyl-Imidazolium Dicyanoamide. The Structural Features Seem To Be More Or Less Independent Of The Partial Charge Set Pointing To A Dominance Of Shape Force As Modeled By Lennard-Jones Parameters. This Can Be Seen In The Radial Distribution And Orientational Correlation Functions. The Role Of Electrostatic Forces Comes In When Studying Dynamical Properties. Here, Significant Deviations Between Different Charge Sets Can Be Observed. Overall, Dynamics Seems To Be Governed By Viscosity. In Fact, All Dynamical Parameters Presented In This Work Can Be Converted From One Charge Set To Another By Viscosity Scaling. (C) 2008 American Institute Of Physics.},

By Comparing Single-Particle And Collective Motion It Is Found That The Madden-Kivelson Relation Is Fairly Fulfilled In Long-Term Simulation Studies (> 100 Ns), I.E., The Collective Reorientation Can Be Predicted By The Corresponding Single-Particle Property And The Static Dipolar Correlation Factor, G(K). Furthermore, Simulated Reorientation Is In Accordance With Hydrodynamic Theories Yielding Hydrodynamic Radii Comparable To Van Der Waals Radii. Since Viscosity Is The Central Quantity Entering Hydrodynamic Formulas, We Calculated And Measured The Viscosity Of Our System In Order To Have Two Independent Cycles Of Hydrodynamic Evaluation, A Computational And An Experimental One. While The Static Dielectric Constant Agrees With Dielectric Reflectance Experiment, The Hydrodynamic Radii Derived From The Experiments Are Much Lower As A Consequence Of Enhanced Rotational Motion. Even More, A Considerable Dynamic Broadening Is Observed In The Experiments.(C) 2007 American Institute Of Physics.},

%  Abstract                 = {We report a molecular dynamics study of the solvation of UCl6-, UCl62-, and UCl63- complexes in the [BMI][Tf2N] and [MeBu3N][Tf2N] ionic liquid cations based on the same anion (bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Tf2N-)) and the butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium+ (BMI+) or methyl-tri-n-butyl-ammonium (MeBu3N+) cation, respectively. The comparison of two electrostatic models of the complexes (ionic model with ???1 charged halides versus quantum mechanically derived charges) yields similar solvation features of a given solute. In the two liquids, the first solvation shell of the complexes is positively charged and evolves from purely cationic in the case of UCl63- to a mixture of cations and anions in the case of UCl6-. UCl63- is exclusively ???coordinated??? to BMI+ or MeBu3N+ solvent cations that mainly interact via their CH aromatic protons or their N???Me group, respectively. Around the less charged UCl6- complex, the cations interact via the less polar moieties (butyl chains of BMI+ or MeBu3N+) and the anions display nonspecific interactions. In no case does the uranium atom further coordinate solvent ions. According to an energy components analysis, UCl63- interacts more attractively with the [BMI][Tf2N] liquid than with [MeBu3N][Tf2N], while UCl6- does not show any preference, suggesting a significant solvation effect of the redox properties of uranium, also supported by free energy perturbation simulations. The effect of ionic liquid (IL) humidity is investigated by simulating the three complexes in 1:8 water/IL mixtures. In contrast to the case of ???naked??? ions (e.g., lanthanide3+, UO22+, alkali, or halides), water has little influence on the solvation of the UCl6n- complexes in the two simulated ILs, as indicated by structural and energy analysis. This is in full agreement with the experimental observations (Nikitenko, S. I.; et al. Inorg. Chem. 2005, 44, 9497).},

We have used octaethylene glycol monotetradecyl ether (C14E8) and octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8) as surfactants. In the [bmim][BF4]-C14E8 micelle, we have observed only a 22% increase in solvation time compared to neat [bmim][BF4], whereas in the [bmim][BF4]-C12E8 system, we have observed ???57% increase in average solvation time due to micelle formation. However, the slowing down in solvation time on going from neat RTIL to RTIL-confined micelles is much smaller compared to that on going from water to water confined micellar aggregates. The 22???57% increase in solvation time is attributed to the slowing down of collective motions of cations and anions in micelles. The rotational relaxation times become faster in both the micelles compare to neat [bmim][BF4].},

The variation of the time constants of solvent relaxation of C-153 is very small with an increase in the {[}bmim]{[}PF6]/ TX-100 ratio (R). The rotational relaxation time of C-153 also remains unchanged in all micremulsions of different R values. The invariance of solvation and rotational relaxation times of C-153 indicates that the position of C-153 remains unaltered with an increase in R and probably the probe is located at the interfacial region of {[}bmim]{[}PF6] and TX-100 in the microemulsions. On the other hand, in the case of C-151, with an increase in R the fast component of the solvation time gradually increases and the slow component gradually decreases, although the change in solvation time is small in comparison to that of microemulsions containing common polar solvents such as water, methanol, acetonitrile, etc. The rotational relaxation time of C-151 increases with an increase in R. This indicates that with an increase in the {[}bmim]{[}PF6] content the number of C-151 molecules in the core of the microemulsions gradually increases. In general, the solvent relaxation time is retarded in this room temperature ionic liquid/ water-containing microemulsion compared to that of a neat solvent, although retardation is very small compared to that of the solvent relaxation time of the conventional solvent in the core of the microemulsions.},

%  Abstract                 = {A series of 11 new protic ionic liquids with fluorous anions (FPILs) have been identified and their self-assembled nanostructure{,} thermal phase transitions and physicochemical properties were investigated. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that fluorocarbon domains have been reported in PILs. The FPILs were prepared from a range of hydrocarbon alkyl and heterocyclic amine cations in combination with the perfluorinated anions heptafluorobutyrate and pentadecafluorooctanoate. The nanostructure of the FPILs was established by using small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS). In the liquid state many of the FPILs showed an intermediate range order{,} or self-assembled nanostructure{,} resulting from segregation of the polar and nonpolar hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon domains of the ionic liquid. In addition{,} the physicochemical properties of the FPILs were determined including the melting point (Tm){,} glass transition (Tg){,} devitrification temperature (Tc){,} thermal stability and the density [small rho]{,} viscosity [small eta]{,} air/liquid surface tension [gamma]LV{,} refractive index nD{,} and ionic conductivity [small kappa]. The FPILs were mostly solids at room temperature{,} however two examples 2-pyrrolidinonium heptafluorobutyrate (PyrroBF) and pyrrolidinium heptafluorobutyrate (PyrrBF) were liquids at room temperature and all of the FPILs melted below 80 [degree]C. Four of the FPILs exhibited a glass transition. The two liquids at room temperature{,} PyrroBF and PyrrBF{,} had a similar density{,} surface tension and refractive index but their viscosity and ionic conductivity were very different due to dissimilar self-assembled nanostructure.},

%  Abstract                 = {In a previous paper (Izvekov, S.; Swanson, J.M.J.; Voth, G.A.J. Phys. Chem. B 2008, 112, 4711), it was shown that the long-ranged electrostatic interactions in condensed phase can be rigorously mapped into effective short-ranged potentials using the force-matching (FM) method. This methodology is referred to as ``coarse-graining in interaction space{''}. In the present paper, the asymptotic behavior of the resulting effective short-ranged interactions is investigated analytically using the theory of FM. The two major finding are: (1) under certain conditions the effective forces naturally approach zero at the FM cutoff radius, and (2) the difference between the effective FM force and the Coulomb force is an approximate linear function at shorter distances. An analytical approximation to the FM short-ranged force is then proposed based on these findings, and the result is numerically tested for liquid water systems.},

The Time Scale For Ver Is Found To Decrease Markedly With The Increasing Solute Dipole Moment, Consonant With Many Previous Studies In Polar Solvents. A Detailed Analysis Of Nonequilibrium Results Shows That For A Dipolar Solute, Dissipation Of An Excess Solute Vibrational Energy Occurs Almost Exclusively Via The Lennard-Jones Interactions Between The Solute And Solvent, While An Oscillatory Energy Exchange Between The Two Is Mainly Controlled By Their Electrostatic Interactions. Regardless Of The Anharmonicity Of The Solute Vibrational Potential, Ver Becomes Accelerated As The Initial Vibrational Energy Increases. This Is Attributed Primarily To The Enhancement In Variations Of The Solvent Force On The Solute Bond, Induced By Large-Amplitude Solute Vibrations. One Interesting Finding Is That If A Time Variable Scaled With The Initial Excitation Energy Is Employed, Dissipation Dynamics Of The Excess Vibrational Energy Of The Dipolar Solute Tend To Show A Universal Behavior Irrespective Of Its Initial Vibrational State. Comparison With Water And Acetonitrile Shows That Overall Characteristics Of Ver In Emi+Pf6- Are Similar To Those In Acetonitrile, While Relaxation In Water Is Much Faster Than The Two. It Is Also Found That The Landau-Teller Theory Predictions For Ver Time Scale Obtained Via Equilibrium Simulations Of The Solvent Force Autocorrelation Function Are In Reasonable Agreement With The Nonequilibrium Results.

%  Abstract                 = {The present study analyses the large structural differences{,} first observed using X-ray diffraction{,} between 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids{,} [Cnmim][Ntf2] (n = 3{,} 6{,} 9){,} and their counterparts with ether-substituted alkyl side chains{,} [(C1OC1)(n/3)mim][Ntf2] (n = 3{,} 6{,} 9). The MD simulations-obtained using a non-polarizable atomistic force-field to model the ionic liquids under discussion-demonstrate that the suppression of the nanostructured nature in the ionic liquids with ether chains is persistent along the entire series and it is not due to any modification of the polar network of the ionic liquid but rather due to the different morphologies of the non-polar regions that surround it. The modification of the non-polar regions-shift from bulky segregated domains in [Cnmim][Ntf2] to thin enveloping ones in [(C1OC1)(n/3)mim][Ntf2]-are caused by the inability of the oxygen-substituted alkyl side chains to pack effectively side by side{,} the existence of kinks along the chain that lead eventually to intra-molecular{,} scorpion-like interactions between the chains and the imidazolium ring{,} and by their stronger interactions with the cations of the polar network via the lone electron pairs of the ether oxygen atoms.},

%  Abstract                 = { The viscosity of ionic liquids based on quaternary ammonium cations is reduced when one of the alkyl chains is replaced by an alkoxy chain ( Zhou et al. Chem. Eur. J. 2005 , 11 , 752. ). A microscopic picture of the role played by the ether function in decreasing the viscosity of quaternary ammonium ionic liquids is provided here by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A model for the ionic liquid N-ethyl-N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, MOENM2E TFSI, is compared to the tetraalkylammonium counterpart. The alkoxy derivative has lower viscosity, higher ionic diffusion coefficients, and higher conductivity than the tetraalkyl system at the same density and temperature. A clear signature of the ether function on the liquid structure is observed in cation?cation correlations, but not in anion?anion or anion?cation correlations. In both the alkyl and the alkoxy ionic liquids, there is aggregation of long chains of neighboring cations within micelle-like structures. The MD simulations indicate that the less effective assembly between the more flexible alkoxy chains, in comparison to alkyl chains, is the structural reason for higher ionic mobility in MOENM2E TFSI. },

Average density and configurational energy of simulated MOENM2E TFSI are interpreted with models that take into account empirical ionic volumes. A throughout comparison of the equilibrium structure of MOENM2E TFSI with previous results for the more common ionic liquids based on imidazolium cations is provided. Several time correlation functions are used to reveal the microscopic dynamics of MOENM2E TFSI. Structural relaxation is discussed by the calculation of simultaneous space?time correlation functions. Temperature effects on transport coefficients (diffusion, conductivity, and viscosity) are investigated. The ratio between the actual conductivity and the estimate from ionic diffusion by the Nernst?Einstein equation indicates that correlated motion of neighboring ions in MOENM2E TFSI is similar to imidazolium ionic liquids. In line with experiment, Walden plot of conductivity and viscosity indicates that simulated MOENM2E TFSI should be classified as a poor ionic liquid. },

It Is Shown That A Meaningful Comparison Requires A Detailed Accounting For Both Thermal And Nonthermal Surface Roughening Effects. The Former Is Due To Thermally Excited Capillary Waves, And The Latter Is Due To The Molecular Zero-Point Motion And Form. These Quantities Influence Very Significantly, But Differently, The Simulated And Measured Density Profiles. Stripping Off These Effects From Both Types Of Profiles Yields The Intrinsic Structure Factor Of The Surface. The Simulated Intrinsic Structure Factors Are Found To Deviate Considerably From The Measured One. The Introduction Of Additional Ad Hoc Surface Roughness To The Simulated Profiles Greatly Reduces The Deviation, However, No Physical Origin For This Effect Can Be Identified. The Method Employed In This Study Should Prove Useful For Simulation-Experiment Comparisons Of Other Liquid Surfaces, Provided They Obey Capillary-Wave Theory, As Do Almost All Liquid Surfaces Studied To Date By X-Ray Reflectivity.},

This approach is demonstrated here with the field of energetic ionic liquids (EILs), which utilizes this design flexibility to find safe synthetic routes to ILs with high energy content and targeted physical properties.},

From These Simulation Studies, It Seems To Be Justified That An Extended Debye-Huumlckel Continuum Model Can Be Used To Understand The Solvation Dynamics Of Ionic Fluids. The Theoretical Underpinning Of Such An Extended Debye-Huumlckel Model Is Presented From The General Dispersion Relation In Electrodynamics. The Connection With The Static Extension From The Dressed Ion Theory Of Electrolyte Solutions Is Also Discussed. Such A Connection Between The Debye-Huumlckel Theory And The Dispersion Relation May Be Exploited To Enhance Our Understanding Of The Electric Double Layer Problem Not Only For The Static Case But Also For Dynamic Situations.},

Analyses Of 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium Bis{[}Trifluoromethanesulfonyl]Imide ({[}Emim]{[}Tf2n]) Deposited On A Ni(111) Substrate Revealed That The {[}Emim](+) And {[}Tf2n](-) Yields Increase Together With The Ni+ Yield At Monolayer Coverage; No Such Increase Was Observed For The Films Deposited On A D2o Spacer Layer. Results Indicated That The {[}Emim]{[}Tf2n] Molecule Is Not Perfectly Ionized; The Ni(111) Surface Accepts (For {[}Emim](+)) Or Donates (For {[}Tf2n](-)) An Electron With Higher Efficiency Than The Counterion Because Of The Metal Band Effect. This Phenomenon Might Be Induced By Electrostatic Interactions Between The Separated Cation And Anion During Sputtering. It Is Also Suggested That The Sputtered Ni Atom Can Be Ionized Nonadiabatically By The Formation Of A Quasimolecule With Adspecies. The Multilayer Of {[}Emim]{[}Tf2n] Deposited At 15 K Has A Porous Structure, Resembling That Of Polar Molecules, Because Of Nonionic Intermolecular Interactions. The Phase Transition Is Identifiable, Together With The Morphological Change In The Crystalline Film, From Temperature Evolutions Of The Secondary Ion Yields.},

The Bonding Natures Of These Materials Are Discussed Based On The Matrix Effect In Positive-Ion Yields. The {[}Emim](+) And Fragment Ions Are Emitted From The {[}Emim]{[}Tf2n] Molecule Unless It Is In Direct Contact With A Metal Surface, Suggesting That The Ions Are Emitted Provided That The Electronic Excitation Can Be Localized In Each Molecule. In Contrast, The Electronic Excitation Tends To Be Delocalized Over The Licl Film, As Evidenced By A Monotonic Increase Of A Li+ Yield In The Multilayer Regime. The Li+ Ion Is Created Via Gas-Phase Ionization Of Desorbed Neutrals Or Emitted Directly From The Surface, In Which Self-Trapped Excitons Or Hot Carriers Created In The Bulk Play A Role. The Li+ And Li+(Licl) Ions Are Emitted Efficiently From Licl Nanoclusters Formed On A Rare-Gas Solid Film Via Coulombic Fission. The Delocalized Nature Of Hot Holes Is Also Manifested By Steep Decay Of The Ion Yields With Increasing Licl Coverage. The Structural Transformation Of {[}Emim]{[}Tf2n] During The Phase Transition Is Also Revealed Based On Esd Positive-Ion Yields As A Function Of Temperature.},

We Observe A Preference Of The In Plane Chloride Coordination With Respect To The Cation Ring Plane As Compared To The Energetic Slightly More Demanding On Top Coordination. Evaluation Of The Different Radial Distribution Functions Demonstrates That The Structure Of The Hydration Shell Around The Ion Pair Differs Significantly From Bulk Water And That No True Ion Pair Dissociation In Terms Of Completely Autonomous Solvation Shells Takes Place On The Timescale Of The Simulation. In Addition, Dipole Moment Distributions Of The Solvent In Distinct Solvation Shells Around Different Functional Parts Of The {[}C(2)C(1)Im]{[}Cl] Ion Pair Are Calculated From Maximally Localized Wannier Functions. The Analysis Of These Distributions Gives Evidence For A Depolarization Of Water Molecules Close To The Hydrophobic Parts Of The Cation As Well As Close To The Anion. Examination Of The Angular Distribution Of Different Oh(H2o)-X Angles In Turn Shows A Linear Coordination Of Chloride Accompanied By A Tangential Orientation Of Water Molecules Around The Hydrophobic Groups, Being A Typical Feature Of Hydrophobic Hydration. Based On These Orientational Aspects, A Structural Model For The Obvious Preference Of Ion Pair Association Is Developed, Which Justifies The Associating Behavior Of Solvated {[}C(2)C(1)Im]{[}Cl] Ions In Terms Of An Energetically Favorable Interface Between The Solvation Shells Of The Anion And The Hydrophobic Parts Of The Cation.},

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily Customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz.

Ion Size Ratios Are Varied Over A Realistic Range (From 1:1 To 5:1) While Holding Other Important Molecular And System Parameters Fixed. In This Way We Isolate And Identify Effects That Stem From Size Disparity Alone. In Strongly Size Disparate Systems The Larger Species (Cations In Our Model) Tend To Dominate The Structure; The Anion-Anion Distribution Is Largely Determined By Anion-Cation Correlations. The Diffusion Coefficients Of Both Species Increase, And The Shear Viscosity Decreases With Increasing Size Disparity. The Influence Of Size Disparity Is Strongest Up To A Size Ratio Of 3:1, Then Decreases, And By 5:1 Both The Diffusion Coefficients And Viscosity Appear To Be Approaching Limiting Values. The Conventional Stokes-Einstein Expression For Diffusion Coefficients Holds Reasonably Well For The Cations But Fails For The Smaller Anions As Size Disparity Increases Likely Due To The Neglect Of Strong Anion-Cation Correlations. The Electrical Conductivity Is Not A Simple Monotonic Function Of Size Disparity; It First Increases Up To Size Ratios Of 2:1, Remains Nearly Constant Until 3:1, Then Decreases Such That The Conductivities Of The 1:1 And 5:1 Systems Are Similar. This Behavior Is Traced To The Competing Influences Of Ion Diffusion (Enhancing) And Ion Densities (Reducing) On Conductivities At Constant Packing Fraction. The Temperature Dependence Of The Transport Properties Is Examined For The 1:1 And 3:1 Systems. In Accord With Experiment, The Temperature Dependence Of All Transport Properties Is Well Represented By The Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann Equation. The Dependence Of The Diffusion Coefficients On The Temperature/Viscosity Ratio Is Well Described By The Fractional Stokes-Einstein Relation D Proportional To(T/Eta)(Beta) With Beta Approximate To 0.8, Consistent With The Exponent Observed For Many Molten Inorganic Salts.},

The pure RTIL reorientational dynamics are identical in form to those of other molecular liquids studied previously by OHD-OKE (two power laws followed by a single exponential decay at long times), but are much slower at room temperature. In contrast, the addition of water to the longer alkyl chain RTILs causes the emergence of a long time biexponential orientational anisotropy decay. Such distinctly biexponential decays have not been seen previously in OHD-OKE experiments on any type of liquid and are analyzed here using a wobbling-in-a-cone model. The slow component for the longer chain RTILs does not obey the Debye-Stokes-Einstein (DSE) equation across the range of solutions, and thus we attribute it to slow cation reorientational diffusion caused by a stiffening of cation alkyl tail tail associations. The fast component of the decay is assigned to the motions (wobbling) of the tethered imidazolium head groups. The wobbling-in-a-cone analysis provides estimates of the range of angles sampled by the imidazolium head group prior to the long time scale complete orientational randomization. The heterogeneous dynamics and non-DSE behavior observed here should have a significant effect on reaction rates in RTIL/water cosolvent mixtures.},

%  Abstract                 = {Both softwood (southern yellow pine) and hardwood (red oak) can be completely dissolved in the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim]OAc) after mild grinding. Complete dissolution was achieved by heating the sample in an oil bath, although wood dissolution can be accelerated by microwave pulses or ultrasound irradiation. It has been shown that [C2mim]OAc is a better solvent for wood than 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C4mim]Cl) and that variables such as type of wood, initial wood load, particle size, etc. affect dissolution and dissolution rates; for example, red oak dissolves better and faster than southern yellow pine. Carbohydrate-free lignin and cellulose-rich materials can be obtained by using the proper reconstitution solvents (e.g., acetone/water 1 : 1 v/v) and approximately 26.1% and 34.9% reductions of lignin content in the reconstituted cellulose-rich materials (from pine and oak, respectively) have been achieved in one dissolution/reconstitution cycle. The regenerated cellulose-rich materials and lignin fractions were characterized and compared with the original wood samples and biopolymer standards. For pine, 59% of the holocellulose (i.e., the sum of cellulose and hemicellulose) in the original wood can be recovered in the cellulose-rich reconstituted material; whereas 31% and 38% of the original lignin is recovered, respectively, as carbohydrate-free lignin and as carbohydrate-bonded lignin in the cellulose-rich material.},

The rates of reaction between diiodide anion radicals in molecular solvents such as H2O, methanol, and ethanol could be estimated by the Debye???Smoluchowski equation, which accounts for electrostatic interactions using dielectric constants for the molecular solvents. In contrast, the rates of reaction between diiodide anion radicals in the ionic liquids were close to the diffusion-limited rates for the neutral molecules, suggesting that electrostatic repulsion between the diiodide anion radicals is weakened by Coulombic shielding in the ionic liquids.},

However, efficient means of separating and depolymerising the components are required. An ionic liquid mixture containing the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation and a mixture of alkylbenzenesulfonates with xylenesulfonate as the main anion was used to extract lignin from sugarcane plant waste at atmospheric pressure and elevated temperatures (170-190 degrees C). The lignin was recovered from the ionic liquid by precipitation, allowing the ionic liquid to be recycled. An extraction yield exceeding 93% was attained. The lignin produced had a molecular weight of 2220 g/mol after acetylation. The regenerated ionic liquid showed good retention of structure and properties. The other product of the extraction was a cellulose pulp, which can be used in further processing.},

%  Abstract                 = {In recent years{,} the designer nature of ionic liquids (ILs) has driven their exploration and exploitation in countless fields among the physical and chemical sciences. A fair measure of the tremendous attention placed on these fluids has been attributed to their inherent designer nature. And yet{,} there are relatively few examples of reviews that emphasize this vital aspect in an exhaustive or meaningful way. In this critical review{,} we systematically survey the physicochemical properties of the collective library of ether- and alcohol-functionalized ILs{,} highlighting the impact of ionic structure on features such as viscosity{,} phase behavior/transitions{,} density{,} thermostability{,} electrochemical properties{,} and polarity (e.g. hydrophilicity{,} hydrogen bonding capability). In the latter portions of this review{,} we emphasize the attractive applications of these functionalized ILs across a range of disciplines{,} including their use as electrolytes or functional fluids for electrochemistry{,} extractions{,} biphasic systems{,} gas separations{,} carbon capture{,} carbohydrate dissolution (particularly{,} the (ligno)celluloses){,} polymer chemistry{,} antimicrobial and antielectrostatic agents{,} organic synthesis{,} biomolecular stabilization and activation{,} and nanoscience. Finally{,} this review discusses anion-functionalized ILs{,} including sulfur- and oxygen-functionalized analogs{,} as well as choline-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs){,} an emerging class of fluids which can be sensibly categorized as semi-molecular cousins to the IL. Finally{,} the toxicity and biodegradability of ether- and alcohol-functionalized ILs are discussed and cautiously evaluated in light of recent reports. By carefully summarizing literature examples on the properties and applications of oxy-functional designer ILs up till now{,} it is our intent that this review offers a barometer for gauging future advances in the field as well as a trigger to spur further contemplation of these seemingly inexhaustible and-relative to their potential-virtually untouched fluids. It is abundantly clear that these remarkable fluidic materials are here to stay{,} just as certain design rules are slowly beginning to emerge. However{,} in fairness{,} serendipity also still plays an undeniable role{,} highlighting the need for both expanded in silico studies and a beacon to attract bright{,} young researchers to the field (406 references).},

The ionic liquids are grouped into four families: 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide, [Cnmim][Ntf2], ionic liquids (with n=2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14); 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, [Cnmim][PF6], ionic liquids (with n=4, 6, 8); ionic liquids based on the trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium cation, [P6 6 6 14], combined with the anions bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide, [Ntf2], acetate, [OAc], and triflate, [OTf]; and [C4mim]-based ionic liquids combined with the anions [OAc], [OTf], methylsulfate [MeSO4], and tetrafluoroborate [BF4]. The data obtained were analysed to determine the effect of (i) temperature, (ii) the alkyl chain length of the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cation, and (iii) the nature of the anion. Different empirical models for the calculation of the densities of the ionic liquids were tested. Molar refractions were also calculated from the volumetric and refractive index data and the values were discussed with the aim of checking their utility in obtaining insights on the intermolecular forces and behaviour in solution of the different ionic liquids.},

The self-diffusion coeff., viscosity, ionic cond., and molar cond. follow the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman equation for temp. dependencies, and the best-fit parameters have been estd., together with the linear fitting parameters for the d. The relative cationic and anionic self-diffusion coeffs. for the RTILs, independently detd. by the pulsed-field-gradient spin-echo NMR method, appear to be influenced by the shape of the cationic structure. A definite order of the summation of the cationic and anionic diffusion coeffs. for the RTILs: [bmim][(CF3SO2)2N] > [bpy][(CF3SO2)2N] > [bmpro][(CF3SO2)2N] > [(n-C4H9)(CH3)3N][(CF3SO2)2N], has been obsd., which coincides with the reverse order to the viscosity data. The ratio of molar cond. obtained from the impedance measurements to that calcd. by the ionic diffusivity using the Nernst-Einstein equation quantifies the active ions contributing to ionic conduction in the diffusion components and follows the order: [bmpro][(CF3SO2)2N] > [(n-C4H9)(CH3)3N][(CF3SO2)2N] > [bpy][(CF3SO2)2N] > [bmim][(CF3SO2)2N] at 30 DegC.

%  Abstract                 = {Room-temp. ionic liqs. (RTILs) are liqs. consisting entirely of ions, and their important properties, e.g., negligible vapor pressure, are considered to result from the ionic nature. However, we do not know how ionic the RTILs are. The ionic nature of the RTILs is defined in this study as the molar cond. ratio (Limp/LNMR), calcd. from the molar cond. measured by the electrochem. impedance method (Limp) and that estd. by use of pulse-field-gradient spin-echo NMR ionic self-diffusion coeffs. and the Nernst-Einstein relation (LNMR). This ratio is compared with solvatochromic polarity scales: anionic donor ability (Lewis basicity), ET(30), hydrogen bond donor acidity (a), and dipolarity/polarizability (p*), as well as NMR chem. shifts. The Limp/LNMR well illustrates the degree of cation-anion aggregation in the RTILs at equil., which can be explained by the effects of anionic donor and cationic acceptor abilities for the RTILs having different anionic and cationic backbone structures with fixed counterparts, and by the inductive and dispersive forces for the various alkyl chain lengths in the cations. As a measure of the electrostatic interaction of the RTILs, the effective ionic concn. (Ceff), which is a dominant parameter for the electrostatic forces of the RTILs, was introduced as the product of Limp/LNMR and the molar concn. and was compared with some phys. properties, such as reported normal b.ps. and distn. rates, glass transition temp., and viscosity. A decrease in Ceff of the RTILs is well correlated with the normal b.p. and distn. rate, whereas the liq.-state dynamics is controlled by a subtle balance between the electrostatic and other intermol. forces.},

All three inorganic salts trigger salting-out effects, leading to significant upward shifts of the L???L demixing temperatures of the systems. The magnitude of the shifts depends on both the water-structuring nature of the salt and its concentration; that is, the effects are correlated with the ionic strength of the solution and the Gibbs free energy of hydration of the inorganic salt.

%  Abstract                 = {A detailed investigation of the phase diagram of 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([bmim][PF6]) is presented on the basis of a wide set of experimental data accessing thermodynamic, structural, and dynamical properties of this important room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL). The combination of quasi adiabatic, continuous calorimetry, wide angle neutron and X-ray diffraction, and quasi elastic neutron scattering allows the exploration of many novel features of this material. Thermodynamic and microscopic structural information is derived on both glassy and crystalline states and compared with results that recently appeared in the literature allowing direct information to be obtained on the existence of two crystalline phases that were not previously characterized and confirming the view that RTILs show a substantial degree of order (even in their amorphous states), which resembles the crystalline order. We highlight a strong connection between structure and dynamics, showing the existence of three temperature ranges in the glassy state across which both the spatial correlation and the dynamics change. The complex crystalline polymorphism in [bmim][PF6] also is investigated; we compare our findings with the corresponding findings for similar RTILs. These results provide a strong experimental basis for the exploration of the features of the phase diagram of RTILs and for the further study of longer alkyl chain salts.},

These Results Provide Experimental Support To Recently Published Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Evidence For Slower, Unresolved Dynamics (Under The Present Experimental Conditions) Is Also Obtained. Both Temperature And Momentum Transfer Dependence Of The Intermediate Incoherent Dynamic Structure Factor Were Investigated, After Fourier Transformation Into The Temporal Domain.

%  Abstract                 = {Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are organic salts that are characterized by low melting points. They are considered to possess a homogeneous microscopic structure. We provide the first experimental evidence of the existence of nanoscale heterogeneities in neat liquid and supercooled RTILs, such as 1-alkyl-3-methyl imidazolium-based salts, using X-ray diffraction. These heterogeneities are of the order of a few nanometers and their size is proportional to the alkyl chain length. These results provide strong support to the findings from recent molecular dynamics simulations, which proposed the occurrence of nanostructures in RTILs, as a consequence of alkyl chains segregation. Moreover, our study addresses the issue of the temperature dependence of the heterogeneities size, showing a behavior that resembles the density one only below the glass transition, thus suggesting a complex behavior above this temperature. These results will provide a novel interpretation approach for the unique chemical physical properties of RTILs.},

The diffusion coefficients of the dissolved Zn(II) and Mn(II) species are not constant, but decrease with the increasing concentrations of these ions, suggesting the formation of aggregated species at higher concentrations. Coatings containing Zn. Mn or Zn-Mn can be obtained by controlled-potential electrolysis. The current efficiencies of Mn electrodeposition in this ionic liquid approach 100%. which is a high improvement comparing to the results obtained in aqueous solution (20-70%). The Mn/Zn ratio of these alloys depended almost completely on Mn(II)/Zn(II) concentration ratio in the ionic liquid. The Zn-Mn alloy deposits obtained in this study were compact, adherent, and exhibited an amorphous structure. The surface morphology of these deposits depended on the Mn/Zn ratio. The addition of Mn up to about 50 a/o improves the corrosion resistance of Zn. However, the addition of Mn beyond this amount decreases the corrosion resistance of the Zn-Mn alloy.},

%  Abstract                 = { Liquid structures of the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide based ionic liquids composed of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium and N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium ([C2mIm+][TFSAà¥?¤?] and [C3mPyrro+][TFSAà¥?¤?], respectively) and Li+ ion solvation structure in their lithium salt solutions were studied by means of high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD) technique with the aid of MD simulations. With regard to neat ionic liquids, a small but significant difference was found at around 3.5 à?¥? in the intermolecular radial distribution functions Ginter(r)s for these two ionic liquids; i.e., Ginter(r) for [C2mIm+][TFSAà¥?¤?] was positioned at a slightly shorter region relative to that for [C3mPyrro+][TFSAà¥?¤?], which suggests that the nearest neighboring cationà¥?¤?anion interaction in the imidazolium ionic liquid is slightly greater than that in the other. With regard to Li+ ion solvation structure, Ginter(r)s for [C2mIm+][TFSAà¥?¤?] dissolving Li+ ion exhibited additional small peak of about 1.9 à?¥? attributable to the Li+à¥?¤?O (TFSAà¥?¤?) atomà¥?¤?atom correlation, though the corresponding peak was unclear in [C3mPyrro+][TFSAà¥?¤?] due to overlapping with the intramolecular atomà¥?¤?atom correlations in [C3mPyrro+]. In addition, the long-range density fluctuation observed in the neat ionic liquids diminished with the increase of Li+ ion concentration for both ionic liquid solutions. These observations indicate that the large scale Li+ ion solvated clusters are formed in the TFSA based ionic liquids, and well support the formation of [Li(TFSA)2]+ cluster clarified by previous Raman spectroscopic studies. MD simulations qualitatively agree with the experimental facts, by which the decrease in the long-range oscillation amplitude of r2{G(r) à¥?¤? 1} for the Li+ containing ionic liquids can be ascribed to the variation in the long-range anionà¥?¤?anion correlations caused by the formation of the Li+ ion solvated clusters. },

The Results Obtained At Ambient Pressure Indicate That The Imidazolium C-H May Exist In Two Different Forms, I.E., Isolated And Network Structures. As The Sample Of Pure Emi(+)Fsa(-) Was Compressed, The Network Configuration Is Favored With Increasing Pressure By Debiting The Isolated Form. For Emi(+)Tfsa(-)/H2o Mixtures, The Imidazolium C-H Peaks Split Into Four Bands At High Pressures. The New Spectral Features At Approximately 3117 And 3190 Cm(-1), Being Concentration Sensitive, Can Be Attributed To The Interactions Between The Imidazolium C-H And Water Molecules. The Alkyl C-H Absorption Exhibits A New Band At Approximately 3025 Cm(-1) Under High Pressures. This Observation Suggests The Formation Of A Certain Water Structure Around The Alkyl C-H Groups. The O-H Stretching Absorption Reveals Two Types Of O-H Species, I.E., Free O-H And Bonded O-H. For Emi(+)Tfsa(-)/H2o Mixtures, The Compression Leads To A Loss Of The Free O-H Band Intensities, And Pressure Somehow Stabilizes The Bonded O-H Configurations.

The complete intermolecular response is captured following resonant excitation with time domain third-order Raman spectroscopy. In a previous report, we introduced this method and used it to probe one point in the intermolecular response as a function of time after solute excitation (Underwood, D. F., Blank, D. A. J. Phys. Chem. A 2003, 107 (7), 956). Here we extend this approach to recover the change in the entire intermolecular response as a function of time. To our knowledge the results provide the first direct measurement of the difference in the equilibrated intermolecular response after excitation of a solute and its evolution during a dipolar solvation event. Excitation of C102 results in a significant increase in the solvent-solute interaction due to a large increase in the dipole moment. The observed change in the intermolecular response is consistent with a rapid change in local solvent density, with intermolecular kinetic energy transfer changing the response on longer time scales. Evolution of the response exhibits a strong frequency dependence and suggests changes over longer distances at longer delay times. The measured change in the spectrum of solvent fluctuations represents a direct experimental confirmation of the breakdown of linear response and confirms predictions from molecular dynamics simulations.},

It is shown that the resulting equilibrium structures account for the observed features of experimental static structure factors when available. A detailed analysis of the simultaneous effect of changing the anion and the alkyl chain on the preferential location of nearest-neighbor anions around the cations is provided. It is shown that regions above and below the imidazolium ring are the preferential ones in case of large anions.

%  Abstract                 = {Four first primary alcohols and 1-octanol were studied with the wide-angle X-ray scattering method using both transmission and reflection techniques at room temperature (293 K). The subsequent radial distribution analysis gives C-O and C-C distances that are in good agreement with the known bond lengths of single alcohol molecules. The shortest averaged C-H and O-H distances are much smaller than those from the gas-phase data. It is deduced that the shortened distance is caused by the deformed electron distribution between H and C atoms. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups occurs at a distance of 2.8 Angstrom, and is a common feature for all the samples. The corresponding coordination number of 1.7 indicates linear chains of about ten molecules. The absence of sharp features in the intensity curves suggests that the arrangement of chains is irregular and that the length of the chains varies.},

Results Are Compared With Our Previous Theoretical Study Of The Emim-Bf4 Molecular Adsorption On Li Surfaces {[}H. Valencia , Phys. Rev. B 78, 205402 (2008)]. For The Emim-Bf4 Crystal Structure, The Present Projector Augmented Wave Scheme With The Generalized Gradient Approximation Can Reproduce Rather Correct Intramolecular Structures As Well As Satisfactory Short-Ranged Intermolecular Distances, While Long-Range Intermolecular Distances Are Overestimated Due To The Lack Of Correct Description Of Long-Range Dispersive Interactions. We Constructed A Coherent Crystal/Crystal Interface Model Where Four Emim-Bf4 Pairs Are Stacked On A P(4x3) Li (100) Surface Cell So As To Simulate Rtil-Layer Deposition On A Li Surface. We Observed Significant Attraction Of Surface Li Ions Toward Contacting Bf4- Anions, Counterbalanced By Electron Transfer Toward Emim+ Cations Near The Interface, Revealing The Tendency Of Easy Ionization Of Li And Li-X-Bf4 Cluster Formation, Coupled With The Reduction Of Emim+. These Features Are Similar To Those Observed In The Emim-Bf4 Molecular Adsorption, While These Have Been Proved To Occur In The Crystal-Layer Adsorption. We Examined The Adhesive Energy, Wetability, And Detailed Electronic Structure At The Crystal/Crystal Interface.},

Thermodynamic Integration And Einstein Crystal Calculations Are Used To Determine The Free Energies Of The Different Possible Solid Structures. In This Way, The Fluid-Solid And Solid-Solid Phase Transitions Are Located. Gibbs-Duhem Integration Is Used To Trace The Full Coexistence Curves Between The Different Phases Involved. Three Different Solid Structures Are Found To Be Stable For The Model Considered; Namely, A Cesium Chloride Structure (Cscl), A Substitutionally Disordered Close Packed Structure Which Is Faced Centered Cubic (Fcc), And A Tetragonal Ordered Structure With A Fcc Arrangement Of Atoms If The Charge Of The Ions Is Not Considered. At High Temperatures, Freezing Leads To The Substitutionally Disordered Close Packed Structure. This Solid Structure Undergoes An Order-Disorder Transition At Low Temperatures Transforming Into The Tetragonal Solid. At Low Temperatures Freezing Leads To The Cesium Chloride Structure (Cscl) Which Undergoes A Phase Transition To The Tetragonal Structure At High Pressures. The Tetragonal Solid Is The Stable Solid Phase At Low Temperatures And High Densities. In A Narrow Range Of Temperatures Direct Coexistence Between The Fluid And The Tetragonal Solid Is Observed. Three Triple Points Are Found For The Model Considered. The Usual Vapor-Liquid-Cscl Solid Triple Point Occurs At T-{*}=0.0225. In Addition, A Fluid-Fcc Disordered-Tetragonal Triple Point Is Located At T-{*}=0.245 And, Finally, A Fluid-Cscl-Tetragonal Triple Point Appears At T-{*}=0.234. The Results Presented Here Can Be Used To Test The Performance Of The Different Theoretical Treatments Of Freezing Available In The Literature. (C) 2003 American Institute Of Physics.},

To Capture The Elastic Responses That Emerge At Small Length Scales, We Attach An Additional Rheological Model Parallel To The Macroscopic Constitutive Equation Of A Fluid. The Widely Used Linear Maxwell Model Is Employed As A Working Choice; Other Models Can Be Used As Well. For A Fluid That Is Newtonian In The Macroscopic Limit, This Approach Results In A Parallel Newtonian-Maxwell Model. For Water, Argon, And An Ionic Liquid, The Power Spectrum Of Momentum Field Autocorrelation Functions Of The Parallel Newtonian-Maxwell Model Agrees Very Well With Those Calculated From All-Atom Md Simulations. To Incorporate Thermal Fluctuations, We Generalize The Equations Of Fhd To Work With Non-Markovian Rheological Models And Colored Noise. The Fluctuating Stress Tensor (White Noise) Is Integrated In Time In The Same Manner As Its Dissipative Counterpart And Numerical Simulations Indicate That This Approach Accurately Preserves The Set Temperature In A Fhd Simulation. By Mapping Position And Velocity Vectors In The Molecular Representation Onto Field Variables, We Bridge The Non-Markovian Fhd With Atomistic Md Simulations. Through This Mapping, We Quantitatively Determine The Transport Coefficients Of The Parallel Newtonian-Maxwell Model For Water And Argon From All-Atom Md Simulations. For Both Fluids, A Significant Enhancement In Elastic Responses Is Observed As The Wave Number Of Hydrodynamic Modes Is Reduced To A Few Nanometers. The Mapping From Particle To Field Representations And The Perturbative Strategy Of Developing Constitutive Equations Provide A Useful Framework For Modeling The Nanoscale Viscoelasticity Of Fluids.},

%  Abstract                 = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) force profiling is used to investigate the structure of adsorbed and solvation layers formed on a mica surface by various room temperature ionic liquids (ILs) ethylammonium nitrate (EAN), ethanolammonium nitrate (EtAN), ethylammonium formate (EAF), propylammonium formate (PAF), ethylmethylammonium formate (EMAF), and dimethylethylammonium formate (DMEAF). At least seven layers are observed for EAN at 14 degrees C (melting point 13 degrees C, decreasing as the temperature is increased to 30 degrees C due to thermal energy disrupting solvophobic forces that lead to segregation of cation alkyl tails from the charged ammonium and nitrate moieties. The number and properties of the solvation layers can also be controlled by introducing an alcohol moiety to the cation's alkyl tail (EtAN), or by replacing the nitrate anion with formate (EAF and PAF), even leading to the detection of distinct cation and anion sublayers. Substitution of primary by secondary or tertiary ammonium cations reduces the number of solvation layers formed, and also weakens the cation layer adsorbed onto mica. The observed solvation and adsorbed layer Structures are discussed in terms of the intermolecular cohesive forces within the ILs.},

%  Abstract                 = {Utilization of natural polymers has attracted increasing attention because of the consumption and over-exploitation of non-renewable resources{,} such as coal and oil. The development of green processing of cellulose{,} the most abundant biorenewable material on Earth{,} is urgent from the viewpoints of both sustainability and environmental protection. The discovery of the dissolution of cellulose in ionic liquids (ILs{,} salts which melt below 100 [degree]C) provides new opportunities for the processing of this biopolymer{,} however{,} many fundamental and practical questions need to be answered in order to determine if this will ultimately be a green or sustainable strategy. In this critical review{,} the open fundamental questions regarding the interactions of cellulose with both the IL cations and anions in the dissolution process are discussed. Investigations have shown that the interactions between the anion and cellulose play an important role in the solvation of cellulose{,} however{,} opinions on the role of the cation are conflicting. Some researchers have concluded that the cations are hydrogen bonding to this biopolymer{,} while others suggest they are not. Our review of the available data has led us to urge the use of more chemical units of solubility{,} such as {'}g cellulose per mole of IL{'} or {'}mol IL per mol hydroxyl in cellulose{'} to provide more consistency in data reporting and more insight into the dissolution mechanism. This review will also assess the greenness and sustainability of IL processing of biomass{,} where it would seem that the choices of cation and anion are critical not only to the science of the dissolution{,} but to the ultimate {'}greenness{'} of any process (142 references).},

Ultramicroelectrode voltammetric, nanosecond laser transient absorbance, and photovoltaic measurements show that a high iodide concentration is required for dye regeneration to compete efficiently with charge recombination. A surprisingly fast reductive quenching process is turned on in pure iodide melts. This channel is unproductive, explaining the lower photocurrents observed under these conditions.},

%  Abstract                 = {The effective force coarse-graining (EF-CG) method was applied to the imidazolium-based nitrate ionic liquids with various alkyl side-chain lengths. The nonbonded EF-CG forces for the ionic liquid with a short side chain were extended to generate the nonbonded forces for the ionic liquids with longer side chains. The EF-CG force fields for the ionic liquids exhibit very good transferability between different systems at various temperatures and are suitable for investigating the mesoscopic structural properties of this class of ionic liquids. The good additivity and ease of manipulation of the EF-CG force fields can allow for an inverse design methodology of ionic liquids at the coarse-grained level. With the EF-CG force field, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at a very large scale has been performed to check the significance of finite size effects on the structural properties. From these MD simulation results, it can be concluded that the finite size effect on the phenomenon of ionic liquid spatial heterogeneity (Wang, Y.; Voth, G. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127,12192) is small and that this phenomenon is indeed a nanostructural behavior which leads to the experimentally observed mesoscopic heterogeneous structure of ionic liquids.},

%  Abstract                 = {An effective force coarse-graining (EF-CG) method is presented in this paper that complements the more general multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) methodology. The EF-CG method determines effective pairwise forces between coarse-grained sites by averaging over the atomistic forces between the corresponding atomic groups in configurations sampled from equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The EF-CG method extracts the transferable part of the MS-CG force field at the cost of reduced accuracy in reproducing certain structural properties. Therefore, the EF-CG method provides an alternative to the MS-CG approach for determining CG force fields that give improved transferability but reduced structural accuracy. The EF-CG method is especially suitable for coarse-graining large molecules with high symmetry, such as bulky organic molecules, and for studying complex phenomena across a range of thermodynamic conditions. The connection between the EF-CG and MS-CG approaches as well as the limitations of the EF-CG method are also discussed. Numerical results for neopentane, methanol and ionic liquid systems illustrate the utility of the method.},

%  Abstract                 = {A recently developed multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) approach for obtaining coarse-grained force fields from fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulation is applied to the challenging case of the EMIM+NO3- ionic liquid. The force-matching in the MS-CG methodology is accomplished with an explicit separation of bonded and nonbonded forces. While the nonbonded forces are adopted from this force-matching approach, the bonded forces are obtained from fitting the statistical configurational data from the atomistic simulations. The many-body electronic polarizability is also successfully broken into effective pair interactions. With a virial constraint fixing the system pressure, the MS-CG models rebuild satisfactory structural and thermodynamic properties for different temperatures. The MS-CG model developed from a modest atomistic simulation is therefore suitable for simulating much larger systems, because the coarse-grained models show significant time integration efficiency. This approach is expected to be general for coarse-graining other ionic liquids, as well as many other liquid-state systems. The limitations of the present coarse-graining procedure are also discussed.},

%  Abstract                 = {In continuation of recent work on the dielectric response of imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2006, 110, 12682), we report on the effect of cation variation on the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity up to 20 GHz of ionic liquids. The salts are comprised of pyrrolidinium, pyridinium, tetraalkylammonium, and triethylsulfonium cations combined with the bis-((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)imide anion. The dielectric spectra resemble those observed for imidazolium salts with the same anion. In all cases, the major contribution results from a diffusive low-frequency response on the time scale of several 100 ps, which shows a broadly distributed kinetics similar to that of spatially heterogeneous states in supercooled and glassy systems rather than that observed in fluid systems. There is evidence for a weak secondary process near 10???20 ps. Perhaps the most interesting difference to imidazolium salts is founded in the missing portions of the spectra due to processes beyond the upper cutoff frequency of 20 GHz. These are lower than that observed for imidazolium-based salts and seem to vanish for tetraalkylammonium and triethylsulfonium salts. As for imidazolium salts, the extrapolated static dielectric constants are on the order of ??S ??? 10???13, classifying these ILs as solvents of moderate polarity.},

%  Abstract                 = {Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts with melting points near room temperature (or by convention below 100à??C). Recently, their unique materials and solvent properties and the growing interest in a sustainable, green chemistry has led to an amazing increase in interest in such salts. A huge number of potential cation and anion families and their many substitution patterns allows the desired properties for specific applications to be selected. Because it is impossible to experimentally investigate even a small fraction of the potential cation anion combinations, a molecular-based understanding of their properties is crucial. However, the unusual complexity of their intermolecular interactions renders molecular-based interpretations difficult, and gives rise to many controversies, speculations, and even myths about the properties that ILs allegedly possess. Herein the current knowledge about the molecular foundations of IL behavior is discussed.},

In Addition We Also Carried Out Pressure-Temperature-Volume (Pvt) Measurements. The Obtained Data Enable Us To Examine The Structural Alpha-Relaxation Time Tau(Alpha) As A Function Of Temperature, Pressure, And Volume. Since The Examined Sample Is A Typical Ionically Conducting Material, We Employed The Dielectric Modulus Formalism To Gain Information About Alpha-Relaxation Process. It Was Found That Application Of Pressure Changes The Shape Of The Modulus Spectrum. The Alpha-Peak Becomes Narrower With Compression. Consequently, It Was Also Shown That The Stretching Parameter Beta(Kww) Increases With Pressure. Based On Experimental Data Both The Isobaric Fragility (M(P)) At Various Pressures And Isothermal Fragility (M(T)) At Various Temperatures Were Calculated. Analyzing The Effect Of Pressure On The Dependences Tau(Alpha)(T) As Well As On The Shape Parameter Of The Alpha-Peak It Was Found That A Phenomenological Correlation Between M(P) And Beta(Kww) Established For Glass Forming Liquids Is Also Valid For Vh Under Condition Of High Compression. The Pressure Dependences Of Glass-Transition Temperature Determined From Dielectric And Volumetric Measurements Have Been Compared. Moreover, Pvt Data Allow Us To Assess The Relative Contribution Of Thermal Energy And Free Volume Fluctuation To The Dramatic Slowing Down Of The Molecular Dynamics In The Vicinity Of T-G. It Is Established From The Ratio Of The Isochronic And Isobaric Expansivities That The Thermal Energy Has A Stronger Effect On The Relaxation Times Than The Free Volume, Although The Latter Contribution Is Significant. Finally, We Also Discuss The Validity Of Thermodynamic Scaling In The Case Of Vh And Examine The Scaling Exponent Gamma At Various Thermodynamic Conditions.

In BmImPF(6), D2O's antisymmetric and symmetric stretching modes are well resolved in the IR absorption spectrum in spite of the fact that the D2O is surrounded by a sea of ions, making it is possible to study inter- and intramolecular dynamics. Both population exchange between the modes and excited-state relaxation to the ground state contribute to the population dynamics. The kinetics for the incoherent population exchange (scattering) between the two modes was determined by the time dependence of the exchange peaks in the 2D IR spectrum. In addition, coherent quantum beats were observed at short time in both the amplitudes and 2D IR band shapes of the modes. The quantum beat decay is caused by dephasing due to both inhomogeneous and homogeneous broadening of the spectral lines. Analysis of the oscillations of the 2D line shapes demonstrates that there is some degree of anticorrelation in the inhomogeneous broadening of the two modes. It is proposed that a distribution in the coupling strength between the local modes that give rise to symmetric and antisymmetric eigenstates is responsible for the anticorrelation. Spectral diffusion, caused by structural evolution of the medium, occurs on multiple time scales and is identical for the two modes within experimental error. The spectral diffusion is fast compared to the time scale for complete orientational randomization of the RTIL. Spectral diffusion of the OD stretch of HOD in BmImPF(6) was also measured, and is essentially the same as that of the D2O modes. Orientational anisotropy measurements of HOD in BmImPF(6) determined the orientational relaxation dynamics of the isolated HOD molecules.},

%  Abstract                 = {In this study, we address the following question about the dynamics of solute molecules in ionic liquids (ILs). Are the intermolecular vibrational motions of nonpolar molecules confined in the nonpolar domains formed by tail aggregation in ILs the same as those in an alkane solvent? To address this question, the optical Kerr effect (OKE) spectrum of CS$_{2}$, in the IL 1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide ({[}C(5)mim]{[}NTf2]) was studied as a function of concentration at 295 K by the use of optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy. The OKE spectrum broadens and shifts to higher frequency as the CS, concentration is decreased from 20 to 10 mol \%; at lower concentrations, no further change in the width of the OKE spectrum is observed. Multicomponent line shape analysis of the OKE spectrum of 5 mol \% CS2 in {[}C(5)mim]{[}NTf2] reveals that the CS, and {[}C(5)mim]{[}NTf2] contributions to the spectrum are separable and that the CS2 contribution is similar to the OKE spectrum of 5 mol \% CS$_{2}$ in n-pentane with the spectrum being lower in frequency and narrower than that of neat CS$_{2}$,. These results Suggest that, at this concentration, CS$_{2}$ molecules are isolated from each other and mainly localized in the nonpolar domains of the IL.},

The structures of these room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) were studied by small-wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS), and their intermolecular dynamics were studied by optical Kerr effect (OKE) spectroscopy. The SWAXS measurements indicate that, on a microscopic scale, the liquid structure of RTILs with symmetric cations is similar to that of RTILs with asymmetric cations. The OKE measurements indicate that the intermolecular dynamics of RTILs with symmetric cations are higher in frequency than those of RTILs with asymmetric cations. These results suggest that the local structure of RTILs with symmetric cations is more solid-like than that of RTILs with asymmetric cations. Further evidence for this difference in local structure on a mesoscopic spatial scale is that the width of the low-Q peak in the SWAXS data is narrower for {[}(C-5)(2)im]{[}NTf2] than for {[}C(5)mim]{[}NTf2]. Moreover, the structure and intermolecular dynamics of the RTILs with ethyl-substituted cations appear to be quite different from those of other RTILs within a given series. This difference is evidenced by a clear change in the dependence of the spectral parameters of the intermolecular part of the OKE spectrum on the alkyl chain length in going from n = 2 to n = 3. The dependence of the SWAXS and OKE data on alkyl chain length is discussed within the context of the nanoscale heterogeneities of RTILs.},

%  Abstract                 = {The intermolecular spectra of three imidazolium ionic liquids were studied as a function of temperature by the use of optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy. The ionic liquids comprise the 1,3-pentylmethylimidazolium cation ([C5mim]+), and the anions, bromide (Br-), hexafluorophosphate (PF6-), and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NTf2-). Whereas the optical Kerr effect (OKE) spectrum of [C5mim][NTf2] is temperature-dependent, the OKE spectra of [C5mim]Br and [C5mim][PF6] are temperature-independent. These results are surprising in light of the fact that the bulk densities of these room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are temperature-dependent. The temperature independence of the OKE spectra and the temperature dependence of the bulk density in [C5mim]Br and [C5mim][PF6] suggest that there are inhomogeneities in the densities of these liquids. The existence of density inhomogeneities is consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations that show RTILs to be nanostructurally organized with nonpolar regions arising from clustering of the alkyl chains and ionic networks arising from charge ordering of the anions and imidazolium rings of the cations. Differences in the temperature dependences of the OKE spectra are rationalized on the basis of the degree of charge ordering in the polar regions of the RTILs.},

The spectra were obtained by the use of optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced Kerr Effect Spectroscopy at 295 K. The OKE spectra of the mixtures are compared with the calculated mole-fraction weighted SLIM of the normalized OKE spectra of the neat liquids. The OKE spectra are nearly additive for {[}C(5)mim]Br/{[}C(5)mim]{[}NTf2] mixtures, but nonadditive for {[}C(5)mim]{[}PF6]/{[}C(5)mim]{[}TFA] mixtures. In the case of the equimolar {[}C(5)mim]{[}PF6]/{[}C(5)mim]{[}TFA] mixture, the nonadditivity is such that the experimental OKE spectrum is narrower than the calculated OKE spectrum. The additivity or nonadditivity of OKE spectra for IL Mixtures call be explained by assuming ionic liquids are nanostructurally organized into nonpolar regions and ionic networks. The ionic networks in mixtures will be characterized by ``random co-networks{''} for anions that are nearly the same In size (PF6- and TFA(-)) and by ``block co-networks{''} for anion,, that differ greatly in size (Br- and NTf2-).},

%  Abstract                 = {Low-frequency spectra of binary room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) mixtures of 1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide and 1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide in the 0-250 cm(-1) region were studied as a function of mole fraction at 295 K. The spectra were obtained by use of optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy (OHD-RIKES). The spectra of these binary mixtures are well described by the weighted sums of the spectra for the neat RTILs. This surprising result implies that the intermolecular modes giving rise to the spectra of the neat liquids must also produce the spectra of the mixtures. Additivity of the OKE spectra can be explained by a model in which locally ordered domains are assumed to exist in the neat liquid with the structures of these locally ordered domains preserved upon mixing. Recently published molecular dynamics simulations show that RTILs are nanostructurally organized with ionic networks and nonpolar regions. If ionic networks also exist in the mixture, the additivity of the OKE spectra implies that there are "blocks"along the network of the mixture that are ordered in the same way as in the neat liquids. These "block co-networks"would have a nanostructural organization resembling that of a block copolymer.},

Comparing The Results For Libr And Rbbr, The Contribution Of The Electrostatic Friction Is Smaller For Rbbr, Which Leads To The Normal Pressure Dependence Of Its Molar Ionic Conductivity. The Negative Values Of The Nernst-Einstein Deviation Parameter For The Ionic Conductivity Of Libr And Sio2 Reported By Previous Md Simulations Are Also Explained Consistently. Furthermore, It Is Shown That The Mechanism For The Anomalous Pressure Dependence Of The Fluidity Of Molten Sio2 Demonstrated In This Work Is Consistent With A Conventional Picture That The Five-Coordinated Silicon Atom Is Important To Enhance The Ionic Mobility.

%  Abstract                 = {A novel ionic liquid crystal (ILC) system (C12MImI/I2) with a smectic A phase used as an electrolyte for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) showed the higher short-circuit current density (JSC) and the higher light-to-electricity conversion efficiency than the system using the non-liquid crystalline ionic liquid (C11MImI/I2), due to the higher conductivity of ILC. To investigate charge transport properties of the electrolytes in detail, the exchange reaction-based diffusion coefficients (Dex) were evaluated. The larger Dex value of ILC supported that the higher conductivity of ILC is attributed to the enhancement of the exchange reaction between iodide species. As a result of formation of the two-dimensional electron conductive pathways organized by the localized I3- and I- at SA layers, the concentration of polyiodide species exemplified by Im- (m = 5, 7, ...) was higher in C12MImI/I2. However, as the increment of the concentration of polyiodide species is less than that of Dex, the contribution of a two-dimensional structure of the conductive pathway through the increase of collision frequency between iodide species was proposed. Furthermore, a quasi-solid-state ionic liquid crystal DSSC was successfully fabricated by employing a low molecular gelator. Addition of the 5.0 g/L gelator to ILC improved light-to-electricity conversion efficiency through the increase of JSC due to the enhancement of the conductivity in C12MImI/I2???gel.},

%  Abstract                 = { Molecular dynamics simulations for the liquid-vacuum interface of the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate (EMIM+/NO3-) were performed for both electronically polarizable and nonpolarizable potential energy surfaces. The interfacial structural properties, such as the oscillation in the number density profile, the orientational ordering, and the local clustering in the interfacial region, were calculated. The simulations with both the polarizable and nonpolarizable model demonstrate the existence of an inhomogeneous interfacial structure normal to the surface layer. It was found for both models that the ethyl tail group on EMIM+ is likely to protrude outward from the surface. In the outmost surface layer, the cation is likely to lie on the surface with the imidazolium ring parallel to the interface, while there is a second region with enhanced density from that in the bulk where the cation preferably slants with the imidazolium ring tending to be perpendicular to the surface. The results also reveal that the electronic polarization effect is important for the ionic liquid interface. It is found that the cation is likely to be segregated at the ionic liquid surface for the polarizable model, while for the nonpolarizable model, the anion is found to be more likely to exhibit such behavior. The surface tension of the polarizable model (58.5 ?? 0.5 mN/m) is much smaller than that of the nonpolarizable model (82.7 +/- 0.6 mN/m), in better agreement with extrapolated experimental measurements on similar ionic liquid systems. },

We found that the 1,3-dimethylimidazolium salt shows the highest ionic conductivity among ionic liquids free from halogenated anions (3.6 ?? 10-2 S cm-1 at 25 ??C), and the elongation of the alkyl chain causes the pronounced depression of fluidity and ionic conductivity. Also, such an elongation gives rise to the increase in the degree of ion association in the liquids, mainly caused by the van der Waals interactions between alkyl chains. N(CN)2 salts with 1-ethyl-2-methylpyrazolium (EMP) and N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium (PY12) cations as well as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMI) cation are liquids at room temperature (RT), while the N-ethylthiazolium salt shows a melting event at higher temperature (57 ??C). Among the three RT ionic liquids with ethyl-containing cations, RT ionic conductivity follows the order EMI > PY12 > EMP, which does not coincide with the order of fluidity at RT (EMI > EMP > PY12). Such a discrepancy is originated from a high degree of ion dissociation in the PY12 salt, which was manifested in the Walden rule deviation and solvatochromic effects. A series of N(CN)2/C(CN)3 binary mixtures of the EMI salts were also prepared. RT ionic conductivity decreases linearly with increasing the molar fraction of C(CN)3 anion.},

In this paper{,} the dissolution of cellulose with ionic liquids and its application were reviewed. Cellulose can be dissolved{,} without derivation{,} in some hydrophilic ionic liquids{,} such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) and 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AMIMCl). Microwave heating significantly accelerates the dissolution process. Cellulose can be easily regenerated from its ionic liquid solutions by addition of water{,} ethanol or acetone. After its regeneration{,} the ionic liquids can be recovered and reused. Fractionation of lignocellulosic materials and preparation of cellulose derivatives and composites are two of its typical applications. Although some basic studies{,} such as economical syntheses of ionic liquids and studies of ionic liquid toxicology{,} are still much needed{,} commercialization of these processes has made great progress in recent years.},

Through the study of four different models we show that the correlation between a particle's mobility and the degree of local order in nearby regions is highly system dependent. We suggest that the strength of the local structure-dynamics correlation in these models is connected to how closely a given liquid conforms to "mean-field" behavior. Finally, we investigate the connection between local ordering and that measured by "point-to-set" correlations, revealing the possibility of a structural origin for a previously observed growing structural length scale.},

%abstract = {We investigate the dynamic propensity in a coarse-grained model of a room-temperature ionic liquid via molecular dynamics simulations. Dynamic propensity is defined as the average of squared displacements for each ion during a given time interval over the isoconfigurational ensemble. As the temperature is lowered, distributions of the dynamic propensity develop fat tails at high values, indicating the presence of dynamic heterogeneity in the system. The increase in the heterogeneity for the cation is more evident than that for the anion, and a high propensity exhibits a large variance in the isoconfigurational ensemble, implying that dynamic propensity is related to ions' motions at a large length scale, rather than a direct measure of the individual ion dynamics. In addition, large non-Gaussian parameters observed for small dynamic propensities reveal intermittent dynamical behaviors of ions. In order to reveal the origin of the dynamic heterogeneity in a room-temperature ionic liquid, a possible correlation between the mobility and dynamic propensity is further probed. It is observed that spatial distributions of the dynamic propensity coincide with those of the mobility. The results suggest a possible connection between the structure and heterogeneous dynamics on large length scales.},

Lett. 93 135701) in a Kob--Andersen binary Lennard-Jones liquid system consisting of 8788 particles. We compute the spatial correlation function for the dynamic propensity as a function of both the reduced temperature T , and the time scale on which the particle displacements are measured. For T ≤ 0.6, we find that non-zero correlations occur at the largest length scale accessible in our system. We also show that a cluster-size analysis of particles with extremal values of the dynamic propensity, as well as 3D visualizations, reveal spatially correlated regions that approach the size of our system as T decreases, consistently with the behavior of the spatial correlation function. Next, we define and examine the 'coordination propensity', the isoconfigurational average of the coordination number of the minority B particles around the majority A particles. We show that a significant correlation exists between the spatial fluctuations of the dynamic and coordination propensities. In addition, we find non-zero correlations of the coordination propensity occurring at the largest length scale accessible in our system for all T in the range 0.466 < T < 1.0. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the length scales of dynamical heterogeneity in glass-forming liquids.},
