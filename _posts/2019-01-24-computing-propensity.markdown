title: "Calculating Propensity for Motion"
categories: physics simulation

There have been some more or less recent journal articles written
by Asaph Widmer-Cooper {% cite Tokuda2005 --file refs %} et al.
using the topic of using the dynamic propensity to give insight
into the dynamics of glassy liquids. The topic came up in my line
of work as a result of its potential applications in
understanding the relationship between molecular structure and
bulk viscosity.
