Welcome to my new attempt at a functional website. My interests are pretty wide, so you'll have to forgive me if I seem to jump from topic to topic. On the other hand, you might also discover that fairly disparate topics are actually much more closely related.

Topics I Follow
===============

If you look through my papers, you'll probably find mostly journal articles related to room-temperature ionic liquids (abbreviated RTILs). Specifically, you'll find articles which make use of mostly classical mechanics to simulate them. 

Here's an example of some code in python. Hopefully it will show up correctly. Also I need to make sure your facilities are capable of rendering equations correctly.

For example, the following equation is what we should expect if we assume $$ \phi $$ is a reproducing kernel function on the Banach space in which $$ u $$ lives.

$$
u(x) = \int_D \phi(x-y)\,u(y)\,dy
$$

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

for i in range(10):
    print('This is %3d' % i)

quit()
{% endhighlight %}

My Repositories
===============

I've built a number of repositories over time.

- [Math Repository][repo_math]
- [RBN Repository][repo_neural]

[repo_math]:   https://github.com/mathemaphysics/math
