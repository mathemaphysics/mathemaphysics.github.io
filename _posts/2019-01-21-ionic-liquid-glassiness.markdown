Welcome to my new attempt at a functional website. My interests are pretty wide, so you'll have to forgive me if I seem to jump from topic to topic. On the other hand, you might also discover that fairly disparate topics are actually much more closely related.

Topics I Follow
===============

If you look through my papers, you'll probably find mostly journal articles related to room-temperature ionic liquids (abbreviated RTILs). Specifically, you'll find articles which make use of mostly classical mechanics to simulate them. 

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
