Welcome to my new attempt at a functional website. My interests are pretty wide, so you'll have to forgive me if I seem to jump from topic to topic. On the other hand, you might also discover that fairly disparate topics are actually much more closely related.

Topics I Follow
===============

If you look through my papers, you'll probably find mostly journal articles related to room-temperature ionic liquids (abbreviated RTILs). Specifically, you'll find articles which make use of mostly classical mechanics to simulate them. 

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

for i in range(10):
    print('This is %3d' % i)

quit()
{% endhighlight %}

My Repositories
===============

I've built a number of repositories over time.

- [Math Repository][repo_math]
- [RBN Repository][repo_neural]

[repo_math]:   https://github.com/mathemaphysics/math
[repo_neural]: https://github.com/mathemaphysics/neural
