<h1 id="why-im-here">Why I’m Here</h1>

<p>Welcome to my new attempt at a functional website. My interests are pretty wide, so you’ll have to forgive me if I seem to jump from topic to topic. On the other hand, you might also discover that fairly disparate topics are actually much more closely related.</p>

<h1 id="topics-i-follow">Topics I Follow</h1>

<p>If you look through my papers, you’ll probably find mostly journal articles related to room-temperature ionic liquids (abbreviated RTILs). Specifically, you’ll find articles which make use of mostly classical mechanics to simulate them.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of some code in python. Hopefully it will show up correctly. Also I need to make sure your facilities are capable of rendering equations correctly.</p>

<p>For example, the following equation is what we should expect if we assume <script type="math/tex">\phi</script> is a reproducing kernel function on the Banach space in which <script type="math/tex">u</script> lives.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">u(x) = \int_D \phi(x-y)\,u(y)\,dy</script>

<p>I’ve built a number of repositories over time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mathemaphysics/math">Math Repository</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mathemaphysics/neural">RBN Repository</a></li>
