The Basic Idea
==============

Writing even the most basic molecular dynamics code can
quickly grow into a massive endeavor. This is probably
because it inevitably involves the mixing of topics crossing
subject boundaries between basic code and data structures to
numerical integration of the equations of motion. So while it
could be a challenge for, I'll do my best to keep thins as
simple as possible.

Classes and Data Structures
